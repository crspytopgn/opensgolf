# Tests the play-time count (crates/simgolf/src/playcount.rs) as a player's game runs it, against a stand-in counter on this
# computer (OPENSGOLF_COUNT_TEST_URL, which only takes 127.0.0.1 or localhost): the counter answering, failing, hanging and
# missing; a read-only and a damaged settings.json; a restart. Each case checks what arrived, what was kept for later, that
# the game kept running (its play-time clock went on) and that it never crashed.
