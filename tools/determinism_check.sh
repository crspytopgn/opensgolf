# Determinism and save fidelity check of OpenSGolf on its free base set (no original game files needed), with the
# simulation fingerprint (SG_FINGERPRINT, docs/PLAYING.md):
#   1. twin runs: the same scripted game twice (a hole, a groundskeeper and a soda vendor, golfers playing for TIME
#      seconds, a celebrity's home, the pro's practice round); the two runs' fingerprints, one per game tick, must be identical,
#   2. save and reload: the same game saved at a game tick a fifth of the way and halfway (SG_SAVE_AT), loaded and played
#      on; from the save on, every game tick's state must be the one the uninterrupted run had,
#   3. both again with the second hole's tee and cup laid but the hole not opened, so both saves are made while the hole
#      being built stands planned (its plan must come back with the save, not be made again with other random numbers),
#   4. with --extras: the first two again with each gameplay extra (sg_core::extras) on in turn (the --extras test hook's bits),
#   5. the save self-check (SG_SELFCHECK=1, selfcheck.rs): each save at a game tick must read back, in memory, to the game
#      it was saved from (tools/selfcheck_test.sh tests its report).
# Each run is on a virtual display; the logs and fingerprint files stay in OUT_DIR. A difference names the first game
# tick the runs part at; SG_FINGERPRINT_PARTS=2 (set for every run) gives each line's sections and fields, which say what
# differs there.
#
# usage: tools/determinism_check.sh [OUT_DIR] [--extras]   (run from the repository root after cargo build --release)
# env:   XVFB   the virtual display command (default "xvfb-run -a"); TIME  seconds of play to simulate (default 300);
