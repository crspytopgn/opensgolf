//! Touch controls for phones and tablets (the browser build and the Android app). The original is a mouse and keyboard game, so this is the port's
//! own layer: it turns touches into the mouse clicks and keys the game already understands.
//!
//! * One finger: a tap is a left click; dragging pans the course (or paints with the current tool); holding still for half a
//!   second is a right click (undo, remove, close a screen). With the raise / lower tool armed, holding still over the course
//!   lowers the ground instead (the desktop's Shift+click, which a tablet has no key for), and dragging on from there keeps
//!   lowering.
//! * Two fingers: dragging pans, pinching steps through the three zoom levels, twisting turns the view a quarter.
//! * A few round touch buttons down the right edge stand in for keys the screen has no button for (game speed, repeat the
//!   last message, turn the building, open the hole, the showcase fly-over, undo); they show only once the screen has been
//!   touched, Turn and Open hole only while they have something to do, Showcase once a hole is open, Undo (left of Speed)
//!   while building with a click to undo.
//! * Aiming the player's pro (the port's own): a mouse aims by hovering and shoots with a click, but a finger has no hover,
//!   so its first tap both aimed and shot. With a finger, a tap on the course sets the target and a one-finger drag moves it
//!   (held clear of the finger, with its distance and club beside it); lifting the finger does not shoot. A round **Swing**
//!   button then takes the shot at the target, exactly the shot a click there takes. Two fingers still move the camera and
//!   a long press is still a right click; the shot shapes stay on the Player panel.
//! * Looking round while aiming (the port's own, issue #75): a one-finger drag moves the target only when it starts on or
//!   near it; a drag anywhere else on the course pans the view (it never shoots), a target dragged to the screen's edge
//!   scrolls the view, a small round button centres the view on the pro's ball, and the first touch aim shows a short hint.
//! * Mouse aim and swing (an OpenSGolf extra, off by default; extras.rs mouse_swing): the mouse aims the pro's shot through
//!   this same path, as a finger whose press is the left button's: a click sets the target, a drag from it moves it (lifted
//!   above the pointer, with the line and the plate), a drag elsewhere looks round, a target dragged to the edge scrolls,
//!   and the Swing and Centre buttons show and take a click. Only the shot: buildings, the touch buttons' column, the long
//!   press and the phone's keyboard stay a finger's; the right button, the wheel and the keys are untouched.
//! * When a name is typed (rename, save) the phone's keyboard is raised: through the page in a browser (web/opensgolf.js),
//!   through miniquad on Android.
