//! The play-time count (the port's own, none of it in the original; docs/PLAYING.md "Play-time count"): so the project can
//! see how many hours are played on each system and version, the game sends one anonymous count to the project's
//! GoatCounter ([`COUNT_URL`], the same counter as the web page's) for every 15 minutes of play, and one when it starts:
//!
//! * `start/<platform>/<version>` once at start, e.g. `start/windows/0.6.0`;
//! * `play-15min/<platform>` for each 15 minutes of play time, e.g. `play-15min/linux-arm64`.
//!
//! The play time is the support reminder's clock (support.rs): real seconds on the course, not paused, not in the
//! background, not on the menus. Nothing else is sent: no ids, names, saved games or course data, and no cookies.
//! `<platform>` is windows, macos, linux, android or web, with `-arm64` on 64-bit ARM (but Android).
//!
//! It is on by default; the first time a course is played the ticker says so once, and Preferences > More > "Count my play
//! time (anonymous)" turns it off for good (kept in settings.json under [`SETTINGS_KEY`]). Builds for a store or a package
//! manager (`OPENSGOLF_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1`: the `opensgolf_store` cfg, build.rs) have none of it: no tick, no notice, nothing
//! sent, and no address in the program.
//!
//! On the desktop and Android each count is one GET of GoatCounter's count address (its documented `/count` pixel: `p` the
//! event's name, `t` its title, `e` an event, `ns` counted every time rather than once a visit, `rnd` against caching),
//! by ureq as the update check uses it (net.rs), on a thread of its own with a short timeout; in the browser the page's
//! own GoatCounter script counts it (web/opensgolf.js sg_playcount; the game is the only one counting play time there, and
//! the page's own "Count my play time" tick off turns it off as the game's tick does). On the desktop and Android a
//! 15-minute count that does not get through (no internet) is kept as a number in settings.json ([`Record::pending`], at
//! most [`MAX_PENDING`], a week's play) and sent with the next count that does, [`BATCH`] at a time a second apart:
//! nothing but the same counts, later; taking the tick off deletes them. The start count is not kept. Nothing is ever
//! shown about a failure.
//!
//! Never from tests or scripted runs: under `cargo test`, with --png, --time or --screen, or with any SG_* test hook
//! nothing is sent and the notice is not shown. Test hook: `SG_PLAYCOUNT_LOG=1` prints each count instead of sending it
//! (and shows the notice, without remembering it), with `SG_PLAYTIME=SECONDS` to start the clock near a mark.
// the address and the User-Agent go unused where nothing is sent from Rust (a store's build, the browser, no `net`)
