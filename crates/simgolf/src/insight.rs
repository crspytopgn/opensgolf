//! OpenSGolf extras: golfer insight (extras.rs). Two observers of the simulation that only read it, each with its own tick
//! in Preferences > OpenSGolf extras:
//!
//! * the landing map: after every golfers' tick the balls in play are followed (sg_core::golfer's ball flags and places,
//!   nothing written back); when a tee shot or an approach comes to rest (a putt, struck on the green, is left out) its
//!   resting place, where it first came down, its number on the hole and the ground it stopped on go into a rolling store
//!   of the hole's last `MAX_SHOTS` shots. Shift+D (or the Information menu) shows them as dots on the course for the hole
//!   under the pointer (or the last one looked at, or the one Hole Stats last showed), coloured by the shot's number, with a
//!   legend counting where they ended up. The legend's tabs switch the dots to heat maps (the port's own, 0.5): where
//!   balls come to rest, where golfers stand waiting (`waiting`: a golfer standing where it stood last tick, its ball and
//!   its partner's still), and where golfers complain (each thought that put a golfer out, at the golfer's tile), for
//!   the hole or the whole course;
//! * comments by hole: every thought a golfer has while playing a hole (the thought bubbles, golfer.rs `event`) is
//!   tallied by hole and kind for this month, last month and this year, and a page (Shift+I, the Information menu, or a
//!   tab after F10 on the tabbed reports) lists each hole's three most frequent with their counts, in the words of the
//!   Customise screen's dialogue labels or the F2 report's lines and in the F2 report's colours of their tone.
//!
//! Both are kept with the game only while their tick is on (a save made with them off is unchanged), and cost a pass over
//! the golfer slots per tick (a few compares each) and a counter per thought.
