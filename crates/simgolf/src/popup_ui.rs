//! The exe's generic popup menu (0x46d6e0, docs/DECODE_MENUS.md 1): a box of centred heading lines and selectable option
//! lines, sized from its longest line, with the Up and Down keys, Enter or Space to accept, Esc to cancel, a click on an
//! option, and greyed options that refuse with the error sound. The Information and System Functions menus of the dock and
//! the Preferences checkboxes are built on it. The box geometry follows the decode; its look follows footage of the
//! original (the retirement question, the SGA's offer, the skill points waiver, the tournament recommendations and the
//! Information menu): see `ChoiceBox`.
