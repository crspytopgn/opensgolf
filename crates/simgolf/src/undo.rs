//! Undo for building and terrain (the port's own, docs/PLAYING.md "Undo"). Before a click on the course the whole game is
//! kept in memory as a save; when the button comes up and the click changed the course (its land, terrain or holes), that
//! save goes on the undo list. Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on a Mac) goes back to the last one: the course, the money and everything else
//! as they were just before that click, as a saved game would load. The list is not saved and starts empty with each game.
