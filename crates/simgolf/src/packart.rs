//! High-resolution art of content packs (docs/MODDING.md, "High-resolution packs and your own art"). The port's own.
//!
//! A pack with `scale = 2` or `4` in its pack.toml, or a sprite given as a PNG sheet, is found by sg_core::vfs::art; this
//! module makes the textures. Like the HD mode (hd.rs) it creates them at the pack's resolution but reports the original's
//! size, so every layout, cut and hit test is unchanged; it works with HD on or off, in Classic and Enhanced. A pack's file
//! comes before the HD pack's upscale (the loaders ask here first), and whatever the pack does not have is loaded as before.
//!
//! With no such pack mounted [`active`] is false and none of this runs, so Classic stays exactly as it was.
