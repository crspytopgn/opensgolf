//! Building tools (the port's own, docs/PLAYING.md "Building tools"; none of it is in the original, and nothing changes until
//! the player uses them):
//!
//! * The measuring tape (' by default, controls.rs "tape"): the straight distance in yards between two points on the course,
//!   drawn as the hole tool's length line is (cursor_ui.rs draw_hole_reach: a white line two pixels wide at alpha 7 tenths,
//!   "N yards" in the game's font). Hold the key and move the pointer, then let go; or press it once, move, and click.
//!   From a tee of a hole the carry from that hole's tee point shows too. Esc, a right click or the key again put it away.
//! * The terrain brush's rectangle and fill on the Build Course panel: Shift+drag paints the rectangle between the press and
//!   the release, Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) fills the region of the same tile type under the pointer, bounded by
//!   the club's land. While Shift is held during the drag or Alt is held over the course, the tiles are outlined and tinted
//!   and the total cost shows by the pointer. Every tile goes through the brush's own paint (App::paint_tiles), so every
//!   rule and price is the one-tile brush's, and the whole area is one undo step (undo.rs keeps the game at the press).
//!
//! * Drag to place (an OpenSGolf extra, off by default: crate::extras drag_place): with a bench, flower bed, ball washer,
//!   willow or scenic bridge armed, a drag lays a row of them along the straight line from the tile pressed to the tile let
//!   go, one per footprint. While the button is held the row's footprints are outlined (white where one fits, red where
//!   not) with the count and total cost by the pointer; on release each goes through App::edit_building, the one-click
//!   placement, so its rules and price are the click's, and the row is one undo step. Esc or a right click cancels it.
//!   Unique buildings (the clubhouse's kind: putting green to airstrip, upgraded by placing again), landmarks (each
//!   chosen and priced on its own), home sites (sold one by one, with their own sums) and paths (which the original
//!   already paints along a drag) are left as they are. With the extra off a drag does what the original's does.
//!
//! The original's Shift with a terrain brush does nothing (apply_tool hands it only to the path, building and elevation
//! tools); its Ctrl+click is the port's right click on a Mac, so the fill takes Alt.
