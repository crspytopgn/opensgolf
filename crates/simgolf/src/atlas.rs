//! The sprite atlas (the port's own; Classic only): people's, animals' and props' frames packed into a few large textures
//! instead of one texture each. Making a texture is slow in a browser (each one holds up the page while the driver sets it
//! up) and a busy course shows thousands of frames, each the first time it is needed, so play hitched as golfers came and
//! went; copying a frame into a page that is already there is quick, and the frames of one page draw together.
//!
//! The picture is the same: each frame keeps a border of copies of its own edge texels (GUTTER), so linear filtering at
//! its edge reads what the frame's own clamped texture would; the pages are filtered like the frames' textures were. When
//! every page is full the one used longest ago is emptied and filled again, a page at a time, never all at once.
//!
//! Frames larger than a page's slot (MAX_SIDE), and everything drawn with Enhanced graphics, HD art or a content pack's
//! art, keep a texture of their own as before.
