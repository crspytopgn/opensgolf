# Parity plan: how "1:1" is checked and what blocks a release

The goal is an OpenTTD style release: a faithful reimplementation that loads the owner's own disc data. Fidelity is only real if it is checked against the original in several independent ways, not only against what has been decoded so far.

## Four checks

1. **Asset coverage (automatic).** `docs/PARITY_AUDIT.md` lists every disc file the exe references that the port never names. Re-run the audit script after each batch of work; the list must shrink. Pattern loaded sets (terrain tiles, FLC animations) need a manual look, so the numbers are an upper bound on gaps, not an exact count.
2. **Screen and action inventory (from the exe).** Every dialog, key handler, button and menu action in the decompile gets a row below with status: done, placeholder, missing. A screen counts as done only when it uses the original art and the original rules.
3. **Placeholder burn down.** Every approximation in code is tagged `PLACEHOLDER`. The count (91 on 2026-10-04) goes down only; a release needs 0, or each remaining one listed here with the reason the exe value cannot be recovered.
4. **Side by side with the real game.** Reference screenshots and play footage of the original, compared screen by screen, and the owner playing and reporting. This is the only check that catches errors in the decoding itself.

## Known gaps found by the first audit (2026-10-04)

The pre-game character page the port used to show does not exist in the original (new game goes straight from the property pick into play; the Customise screen opens from the Golfers dock tab). It was removed.

| Area | Gap | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Character | DONE (first pass): Customise screen on the original art, face picker, .pro load and save, advisor portrait. Still open: preview bodies (palette swaps), exact trait and toggle label texts, hit centres from the exe tables, stock default sayings, Save portrait | CustGolfBckgrnd, CGButtons, HeadSelect, HeadBodyBck; spec in DECODE_CUSTOMISE.md |
| Faces | Advisor popup, Customise and the golfer info card done. Open: stats card, pair selection, Pick a Pro, remark popups for golfers, member heads (exe table unknown, port uses a PLACEHOLDER rule) | spec in DECODE_FACES.md |
| Pick a Pro | Championship flow, course picker and Pick A Pro screen built (headless only). Left panel done (portrait, ten skill rows, signature saying; stock saying is a PLACEHOLDER) | Title_Pickapro.pcx, .pro files in Themes/Championship |
| Pair selection | Not built (spec DECODE_TOP10_PAIR.md section 3; the exe's call site is unknown and the port has no waiting queue yet) | PairBase, PairButtons |
| Golfer card | DONE (first pass, single layout): plate, ball and face, five meters, 18 hole scorecard, five round buttons with hover art and tooltip. Open: partner layout (needs group play), shaded backdrop and s_GolferStats shadow, stats card (skills dialog), exact text lines (exe literals unknown, port lines are PLACEHOLDER), Customize and View Story buttons (drawn pale, no action) | GolferStats; spec DECODE_GOLFERCARD.md |
| Course info | courseinfo art unused | courseinfo, s_courseinfo |
| Top 10 | DONE: record file, score and insert rules (tested), trophy screen on the real art, submitted at end of year and shown if the club made the table. Open: Top10_Charms and TrophyMantle (the exe never references them), key F11 is a PLACEHOLDER for the Information menu | Top10_Trophies, Top10_Blank |
| Low score screen | lowscore.pcx unused | |
| Title | DONE (first pass): difficulty select, theme packs and Load Previous Game on the real art. Open: Load side panel (course info, thumbnail), delete yes/no box, scroll thumb drag, theme pack contents are not used by the game yet, multi-slot save names | Title_LoadGame, Title_ThemePacks, TitleSelDiff |
| Voices | DONE (first pass): clips play per reaction type and gender (docs/DECODE_VOICES.md). Open: pan, pitch jitter, start delays, emotion banks for types 1, 2, 3, 8, type 12 and 13 clip choice, staff lines, id to file map is rebuilt from meaning | SimsFX |
| Bodies | 32 of 42 body sprite files unused | golfer and employee clothing variants and palette swaps |
| Credits | DONE (first pass): scrolling text over the background, logo marker. Opened by clicking the title logo (PLACEHOLDER, the exe's trigger is unknown) | credits.txt, creditsbckgrd |
| Mood face bug | FIXED 2026-10-04 (reversed order) | compact dock layout still open |

## Order of work

1. Character customise screen and faces (visible, owner reported).
2. Voices for reactions (reaction engine already knows the type).
3. Pick a Pro, pair selection, golfer card, course info, Top 10, low score.
4. Title screen remainder, credits.
5. Placeholder burn down, starting with the terrain penalty table and aim search.

## Rules for every change (so a gap is never silent)

* Before building any screen or feature, check what the exe draws and plays for it: list the art files, sounds and animations it references (grep the decompile for the screen's routine) and use them. A screen built from flat boxes is a placeholder and must be tagged `PLACEHOLDER` with the art it should use.
* After each batch run `python3 tools/parity_audit.py GAME_DIR spec/golf_decomp.c` and compare the gap count with the last commit; it must not rise, and the finished screen's files must leave the list. (The script now reads the Rust crates as well as the old C++ tree; on 2026-10-10 it counts 411 gaps, most of them FLC sets loaded by pattern.)
* Update the gap table above in the same commit.

## Update 67 additions (headless only, never run on the Mac)
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| HUD | Top bar uses the original courseinfo art and shade sheet |
| Best Scores | Module, test, recording, persistence and screen done; trigger keys F12 (Best), F11 (Top 10), Shift+K are PLACEHOLDERS until menus fully replace them |

EXACT: the frame, fill, text colours and offsets, radio balls, checkboxes and OK tick (0x46d6e0, DECODE_MENUS 1), the list box 0x46de70, the retirement question's rules. PLACEHOLDER: Preferences labels beyond three (the port adds Sound, HD graphics, *Content packs...* and *Enhanced graphics...*, the last two command lines drawn without a checkbox that open the port's Preferences > Content screen, docs/MODDING.md, and the Enhanced graphics checkbox list, docs/ENHANCED.md). Load Game saves a While Browsing file but Cancel does not yet restore it |
| Open | Load screen emblem and tooltips, pair selection trigger, stats card, golfer bodies and palettes, play-core constants from DECODE_PLAYCORE.md, world facts from DECODE_WORLD2.md |
Audit count: 982 gaps (down from 987).

## Update 68 additions (headless only, never run on the Mac)
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Pick A Pro | Left panel on the real art |
| Load screen | Club emblem (parklink/tropdesert cuts) replaces the thumbnail; Cancel/Delete tooltips; Loading... text; delete yes/no box in the popup frame; Cancel from System Load restores the While Browsing save. PLACEHOLDER: OK tooltip word, second delete option wording |
| Pair selection | Screen built from PairBase/PairButtons; trigger key backquote is a PLACEHOLDER (exe call site unknown); trait labels and ages are stand-ins; pairing only announced |
| Not done | Golfer stats card (skills dialog), golfer bodies and palettes, play-core constant swaps, world data facts |

## Update 69 additions (headless only, never run on the Mac)
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Surface table | include/sg/lie.h holds the exe's 23 surface records (bounce, friction, penalty, costs, walk effort, class) read from golf.exe's data section; the port's tile ids map onto them (editor-only tiles are PLACEHOLDER picks) |
| Ball flight | include/sg/ballphys.h runs the exe's per-tick flight, bounce (rebound = -64 + vertical * k / 12, rolls under 0x80), ground friction, water stop and tree hits. Shots now pick the launch range by previewing the roll, as the exe does. PLACEHOLDER: slope term, edge friction, curve of draw and fade, tick rate in seconds |
| Ball washer | Golfers whose tee has a washer within 3 tiles lose a third of their direction error, cleared when the ball stops off the fairway (EXACT rule) |
| Heiress | Exact landmark draw, separate available mask (strip lists only available designs) and free mask; price fixed to 50 + 10 * kind units; donation message names design, value, placement and effect. PLACEHOLDER: starting available set (0x000f; sandbox all) |
| Save dialog | System menu Save Game opens the exe's box (54,80,628x80, 48 character field, default name course + day + month + year, trim and character check, overwrite confirm) |
| Skills panel | Read only skills panel from the golfer card (S key is a PLACEHOLDER trigger); panel art is the popup frame, row strips unmeasured |
| Golfer colours | Palette composer (Swap01..10) recolours in-world golfers by shirt, pants, skin, hat, alternate skin; members use their progolfers.dta row. PLACEHOLDER: female hair, default skin for non members. Customise preview bodies not done |
| Tests | ballphys, shot and visitors tests added (10 in all) |
| Not done | Customise preview bodies and the stats card art, tutorial triggers, SGA offer popup art, employee Move and Rename, multi slot saves |

## Update 70 additions (headless only, never run on the Mac)
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Club emblem | Property to emblem table (parklink and tropdesert cuts, DERIVED from the art and your real HUD screenshots: Las Vegas roulette, Ireland shield, Hawaii flamingo agree) replaces the old prop/8 guess; Load panel and in-game HUD both use it |
| HUD emblem | Drawn at the left of the course pill via new ui::drawImageScaled; 76 px size and position are PLACEHOLDER (measured by eye from screenshots) |
| Terrain generator | Terrain::generate from the site record: theme scatter mix, coastal shore on one side, island ring on four, ponds inland, relief amplitude from terrain kind and price slot (96 / base, PLACEHOLDER reading of the exe's 0x30/0x20/0x10 base height), clubhouse at a random cell of the 17 x 17 centre window with a cleared lot. The exe's stroke tables are not decoded, so the land is generated, not the original's |
| Starting land | The tract holding the clubhouse first, then nearest tracts (PLACEHOLDER count and order) |
| Ugly landmarks | As many as the difficulty, kind 16 parkland, 18 desert, 17 tropical and links, on open rough ground; their pictures (Radio Tower, Red Oil Pump, TarPit, Railroad Tracks) are PLACEHOLDER picks; golfers that glance at one get the ugly view reaction |
| Skills dialog | Editable dialog for your own character at X = 200 (frame, name, "N skill points", ten rows with add/refund toggles, value badges, cream name boxes, portrait, OK, unspent confirm); rules per DECODE_CARDS2 (cap 10, refund only to the entry value). Opens at a normal new game with 10 minus spent points; badge, toggle and name box shapes are PLACEHOLDER because the row sprites are not located; skills do not change shot accuracy yet |
| Test hooks | --prop N, --skills |
| Tests | terrain_gen added (11 in all) |
| Not done | 18-dot rating row, Paused label, Customise preview bodies, stats card art, tutorial triggers, SGA offer popup art, employee Move and Rename, Information menu styling |

## Update 71 additions (headless only, never run on the Mac)
| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Skills dialog | Rebuilt to match the real screenshot: black panel with a lavender edge, yellow "Add N skill points." line, oval toggles, cream "+N0%" ovals and name boxes, standing portrait (Bodies/<set>.pcx recoloured with the swap palette, head on top at the Customise offsets) on a white oval, explanation box under the dialog. Shapes and colours measured by eye (PLACEHOLDER) |
| Skill points | Closing the dialog sets the player's tournament skills (point x 1.5, cap 15); the exe's real use of each skill in the player's shots is still the shot model's |
| HUD rating row | Golf ball dots, stars (course grade + 1) and hearts from StarsHeartsETC.pcx, spaced over 146 px; flags per hole up to six, otherwise a flag and "x N". The dot count (1.5 per hole) is PLACEHOLDER; the hearts counter is 0 until happy endings are tracked |
| HUD text | Course name and date moved to the real rows; money green (red when negative), fun yellow, skill cyan, as in the screenshots; "Paused" label at the top centre (position DERIVED) |
| Notices | `say` messages use the dark green translucent panel with lavender edge; SGA offers show the trophy plate (geometry PLACEHOLDER) |
| Menus | Information and System menus restyled (slate panel, heading row, teal items, amber ball bullets, no OK button) and the heading row now sits inside the exe's (n*3+3)*8 height |
| Employees | Per-employee names (Rename Employee prompt, 31 characters), hire date, Move (armed, next map click places the employee), Fire removes that employee; info box text is dark (PLACEHOLDER colour); Paid is wage x months employed (PLACEHOLDER) |
| Shot Analysis | Analyze Golf Shot tool and the / key: 5 sample first shots for ALL skills, no Imagination, no Accuracy, no Length drawn on the hole, with the panel and a yards figure (DERIVED: closer to the green than the all-skills average; the exe's own routine is not decoded) |
| Bug fix | Body palette loader used a 96 byte path buffer, so a long install path silently disabled recoloured golfers; now a std::string |
| Test hooks | --empsel N, --say TEXT, --analyze N |
| Not done | Customise preview bodies, stats card art, tutorial triggers, employee info colours, per-employee counters and wages, happy ending hearts, Practice Round button |

## Update 72 additions

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Course emblems (HUD, 16 sites) | DERIVED | Sheet/cut table checked against three real screenshots |
| World map status dots, globe pins, legend | DERIVED | Pin positions from the site table match the real map |
| Font capital I glyph | EXACT quirk | Mapped to the l glyph |
| Customise preview stack (body, head, two walkers) | DERIVED | Offsets measured by eye, PLACEHOLDER |
| Story selection from Themes/Standard and More_Stories | DERIVED | First pair forced to OpeningDay; later pairs by seed and count |
| Story happy ending | EXACT table, DERIVED trigger | Full pass of the story lines ends it: hearts +1, highlight 0x120, landmark donated by first letter (DECODE_WORLD2 1.5). The chapter timing is a PLACEHOLDER |
| clang -Wall pass | checked | 3 harmless warnings, no portability errors in sgview.cpp |

Not yet run on the Mac. Headless checks only.

## Update 73 fixes

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Colour-key fringe | fixed | Keyed art loses blended key-colour edge pixels, and transparent pixels take the nearest opaque colour so filtering cannot pull pink in |
| Skills dialog OK button | fixed | Drawn through a circle mask (the art is a round button on a square lavender backdrop) |
| Starting land | PLACEHOLDER | Tracts owned at start = clamp((acres + 10) / 15, 4, 9); the exe's real starting ownership is still not decoded |

## Update 74 additions

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Player panel (JoeCoolPanel, dock modes 3 and 4) | EXACT | crates/simgolf/src/player_panel.rs (dock panel 5). Hit zones, draw table (0x4c7ac0), cut states (hover, selected, disabled, idle at x 0/50/100/150, ovals 0/100/200/300), enable conditions, skill list (494,540), the round scorecard over the cover cut (0x461110) and tooltips read from the exe. Port choices: the shot ovals' hits follow the aim (exe: any mode 3), each oval uses its own alpha cell (the exe's two alpha cells are near identical), Customise opens on the pro's slot (exe: slot 0x98); the panel has no cancel button, N twice still cancels |
| Practice Round | DERIVED | Needs two open holes and no player out; the player's character walks the course with its own skills and body, pays no fee, is not recorded in the books and never quits. Play (vs a pro) and Begin Tournament only show a notice |
| Shot shape ovals | DERIVED | Selection is stored and drawn; it does not change shots yet |
| Hole open message | PLACEHOLDER wording | Odd and even hole texts and the dogleg side follow DECODE_WORLD2 5.4 |
| Building advice | DERIVED | Advisor suggests the newest unlocked building that is not built yet |
| Unowned land | DERIVED | Drawn black as in the real game |
| Course Report | fixed | The keyed gap under the Total row is lavender; legend labels moved down |
| Title screen | fixed | Logo blob no longer cut; Start New Game on two lines; Theme line only for non-standard packs |

Not run on the Mac. Practice Round clicks were not exercised, only the hooked headless render.

## Update 75 additions

| Area | State | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Shot shapes | PLACEHOLDER numbers | The player's chosen oval now bends (fade, draw), tightens (backspin) or shortens (punch) the player's own shots; reliability follows the matching skill |
| Match against a pro | DERIVED | A pro within a quarter of the table size of the player's skill sum may challenge each month (one in three); Play starts player and pro on the course, holes are compared when both finish, the winner collects or pays the lead times the wager. Wager, odds and window are PLACEHOLDER; "First match victory" is awarded |
| Cancel Match | DERIVED | System menu item works while a match is on |
| Begin Tournament button | EXACT enable rule | Lit while an SGA offer is pending; opens the SGA response screen |
| Per-employee counters | DERIVED | Each employee keeps own greeted, hurried or sold count in the info box; a loaded game restarts the individual counts |
| Tutorial | structure EXACT, wording my own, start key PLACEHOLDER | 11 fun and 9 skill pages, any key advances, Escape stops, game pauses; Shift+F8 starts it |

Tested headless only (a hooked match run to a win, the tutorial page render); not run on the Mac, no button clicks exercised.

## Update 76 additions

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Refusal, chip, TaDa, Twinkle, bagpipe, end-of-year, tournament place sounds | DERIVED | Wired to the shipped wav files; trigger points are my reading |
| Emotion voice clips | weak reading | Bank-to-reaction mapping guessed from file names |
| Bottom golfer mood strip | PLACEHOLDER position | Round faces from MemberPanel.pcx with number cells; click opens the golfer card |
| Name tags over golfers and staff | EXACT font and place, PLACEHOLDER toggle | 0x462be0: Arial Bold 10 at zoom 4 (Manual SSi 15 above), centred with the text's top at the golfer's point, no shadow; the Shift+N toggle is mine |
| Text sizes and placement | EXACT | The exe's font size is GDI's em height in pixels (jgl.dll builds a LOGFONT with lfHeight = -size); a text call's y is the top, the baseline sitting tmAscent - tmInternalLeading below it (TA_BASELINE TextOut), widths in whole pixels per glyph. ui::Fnt carries face and size for each font object (F_ARIAL10, F_MANUAL15, F_MANUAL20, F_KLEPTO18/24, F_MANUAL24, the info set F_INFO_TITLE/F_INFO20/16/14) and Screen::put* place text by its top. Converted: HUD, ticker, thoughts and advisor bubbles, names, floating money, tooltip bars, the Amenities info box, golfer card, pair screen, top 10, the info screens' titles and bodies (report, hole stats, best scores, comments, histograph, finance, shortcuts, SGA, results, leaderboard, year end, land, hire), the title menu, difficulty, load and theme screens and the credits |
| Ticker strip and dialog frame fills | EXACT | 0x40ca10 darkens 16 x 16 tiles through s_TransPopups masks (the frame's 3 x 3 rounded cuts by tile place, the strip's square at (317, 0)) with colour table 0x824148, which halves each channel; the rail pieces are TransPopups (300/317/334, 34), cut by 0x4466b1 |
| Tooltip bar | EXACT | 0x432620: Arial Bold 10, three pixels per character either side of the point (kept on screen), a black line 10 thick at half opacity (Terrain::drawLine's last argument is the alpha in tenths), white text centred with its top 5 above the point; the golfer card's button tips use it at the pointer |
| Frame-counted delays and blinks | EXACT count, DERIVED pace | The exe draws one frame per 87 ms game tick, and its hover delays count those frames: dock tooltip 11, terrain and building panel 10, golfer card 7, file screens 30, Customise 10, world map 20, the paused Pause button's blink. The port draws at the display's refresh rate, so App::count_exe_frames counts the exe's frames on the wall clock (exe_steps) and these counters add them (they ran two to five times too fast at 60 to 144 Hz). Game-tick blinks (hole marks, advisor, thoughts) already followed the tick |
| Terrain button tooltip | EXACT, DERIVED text file match | 0x433190: the translucent frame (x - 80, 402, 160 x 112) with its TransPopups tab strip, the name, " $" and the cost in Manual SSi 15, the lie's mood face, the description from Interface/<theme>.txt (the line after "*Name", matched without case: DERIVED) wrapped at 128 in Arial Bold 10, the bounce and roll meters with the GBUBBLES ball; the exe's "Lie:" words are built and never drawn. The amenity strip's box is still a PLACEHOLDER |
| Speech bubbles (thoughts, advisor) | EXACT, DERIVED tail | Text top at zoom * 10 above the person, Arial Bold 10 at zoom 4 (Manual SSi 15 above), a 10 pixel half black line the text's width plus 8, the tail cut (512, 140) of course1.pcx at (x + 4, y + 10) through the halving table; the tail's shape (its darker pixels) is DERIVED |
| Flower beds under rotation | EXACT | 0x41266b rotates the neighbour mask right one place per quarter turn (0x5685f4 / 2) before the piece table, so pieces follow the screen; the single and four-sided pieces keep view (a - 2b) & 3 whatever the camera |
| Tee arrows (issue #100) | EXACT | The tile pass (0x4120ae..0x41232b) rewrites each drawn tee tile's variant byte from its hole: 0 (TeeA0001, the round mark) while the hole is not open, else ((0x5685f4 - tee facing - 2) & 7) * 3 + 1, plus 1 for a dogleg left (hole flag 0x20), plus 2 for a dogleg right (0x40), the byte being Terrain.dll's tee set (its loader 0x1000782d reads TeeA0001..TeeA0025 as 25 sets). Terrain.dll turns every vertex's texture coordinates a quarter per view phase (table 0x10063ca0), which the camera term undoes, so the arrow stays on the hole in every view; the port turns the tee tiles' coordinates only (`terrain::view_uv`) and keeps the byte in the renderer's terrain, not the saved land. `decor::tee_arrow`, `App::update_tee_arrows` |
| Landmarks on the course | EXACT | 0x463180 case 4: sprite 0x168 + type in palette 100 + type, view (facing + rot / 2) & 3, type 3 turning by the full eighth count |
| Weedy flower bed palette | EXACT | The exe loads palette 0xbb only from flics\bldgs\flowers\...IckyPal, which the disc does not have, so the load fails and the palette object stays empty. The tile loop's paletted blit (0x4741b0, jgl.dll sprite vtable +0x78 at 0x100098c0) keeps the palette it is given in the sprite object and, given none, draws in the one kept (the +0x6c blit restores it, +0x78 and +0x4c do not). So a weedy bed shows the colour its piece sprite was last drawn in: the previous bed of that piece in the tile loop (b outer, a inner, tiles on the screen), or the Flowers design strip's last icon of that shape (0x432200 draws through the same sprites after the map), or the FLC's own palette before any. `App::bed_palette`, render.rs |
| Edge of the property (cliff) | EXACT | Terrain.dll 0x1000ea30: every tile not out of bounds gets, on each side whose neighbour exists and is type 20, a face from the side's end vertices down to height -75 textured once with the theme's strata.bmp; sides drawn by view (-y: views 1, 2; +y: 0, 3; -x: 0, 1; +x: 2, 3) with the normal table at 0x10063c40 (two per side by view parity, not unit length, so the shader no longer normalises normals). The map's own border has no wall. Matches footage p1 1700 (the stone edge along Dolphin Coast). `App::build_edge_walls` |
| Retaining walls and per-tile ground | EXACT | Terrain.dll 0x1000f7f0 (found and decompiled with REA): a side whose wall flag (Tile+0x234 + side) is set and whose neighbour exists gets four triangles from the tile's three vertices on that side (t 0) to the neighbour's three on the same spot (t 1), u 0, 0.5, 1 along it, so the picture is stretched over the step; style 1 (terrain table +0x28, water only) binds CliffTest.bmp (texture 35), every other RetainWallA.bmp (34) (the loader 0x10007e8a..0x10007f9f, GL_REPEAT, linear); the normal is the cliff's (0x10063c40) by view parity; back faces culled (0x100034a3), so only sides facing the camera show. The tiles have their own corners: golf.exe 0x449540 calls elevateCorner (level - 3) times per corner from 0x40bfe0 (tees at their highest corner, pot bunkers at their lowest, buildings at their level, wetlands at sea level) and leaves water at sea level, so flattened tiles step; that leaves black holes along water above sea level, so "Fix original bugs" (on by default) gives water its level instead (docs/FIXES.md 1). `Terrain::tile_corner`, `App::sync_tile_corners`, `App::build_walls` |
| Original bugs | fixed, setting | docs/FIXES.md: water above sea level drawn at its level (no black triangles at waterfalls), no second lot on a standing one, upgrades offered when unlocked, Esc closes the golfer card, new arrivals do not overwrite slow golfers; behind "Fix the original game's bugs" (Preferences; on by default, Classic too). HD bank rocks, Enhanced reflections on stepped water, wide-window culling and sprite frame bounds fixed always |
| World overlay lines | EXACT | Terrain::drawLine's last argument is the alpha in tenths and its colour each 5-bit channel times 8 over 255 (Terrain.dll 0x100048a0). Every world line passes 7: aim line and its shadow (0x41bbdc), hole length line (0x41af71), elevation block outline (0x41617f), footprint (0x419e6a), landmark ring and shot analysis circles (0x407c60), analysis tracks (0x41d5f0), sweet shot streak (0x415809); the hole layout path's white line 9 over a black one at 7 (0x41382f, 0x4137fe). `ui::line_rgba` |
| Paths on course tiles | EXACT | Terrain.dll keeps a draw flag beside the path flag (Tile+0x20a, +0x208): setPath (0x10013400) and setType (0x10014020, through 0x1000d480, 0x1000d540 and 0x10015230) clear it on tees, greens, fairways, firm fairways, types 7 and 9 and buildings, and the tile's path draw (0x100108f0) returns without it, so those tiles show their ground; neighbours read the path flag and still run their arms up to the tile. `App::build_paths` |
| Path pieces and colours | EXACT | Terrain.dll 0x100108f0: an arm per neighbour with a path (N 1, S 2, E 4, W 8), a third of the tile wide from the centre to the edge, from Path.tga's outer third; then 0x100116d0 picks per mask what goes on the centre's four triangles (centre and two edge midpoints): PathInside between two arms, PathCurve on the sides with no neighbour (a lone tile all four, an end two, a bend's outside one), nothing on a straight. The art set is the tile's +0x209 byte, set by layPath/updatePath from the exe's clubhouse flag 0x40 (wrapper 0x44a410): the grey `*X` art joined, the tan plain art not (issue #101). `sg_core::terrain::path_centre`, `App::build_paths` |
| Bridges under rotation | EXACT | 0x41192c reads the four path neighbours by screen heading ((0x5685f4 + 2k) & 7), so the masks turn right one place per quarter turn before the piece table, like the flower beds; the caps' screen offsets follow the screen |
| Wildlife kind table | EXACT | 0x4c1998, nine records of 18 bytes: name (Elk, Crane, Flamingo, Sheep, Crocodile, Snake, Gila, Road runner, Duck), habitat type (14, 4, 15, 4, 4, 12, 4, 4, 4) and theme mask (9, 1, 4, 8, 4, 6, 2, 2, 12), read from the publisher exe |
| Player Comments report | EXACT | 0x4546b0: rows from the header piece's height + 22 (124), words 2 lower; nothing in place of the rows when none was recorded; OkStates tick at (591, bottom piece + 14) |
| Histograph | EXACT | 0x455ed0: labels Skill, Cash, Fun, Event centred at y 542; the skill scale in the hundredths format (0x42dd50: 0.00 .. 5.00, 10.00 .. 25.00, doubled over 2500); plot lines from last month's height to this month's (0x478b80) clipped to (106, 72, 598 x 450); only the cash line mirrors a small negative sample; event marks: 2 x 2 dot on the skill line at x + 10, cyan stalk at x + 11, dot on top, words left at (x + 14, top - 3) |
| Shadow strength | EXACT | jgl's blit (0x10013400, decompiled with REA) draws palette indices 0xf8..0xfc of a sprite through the shading tables the exe passes it (0x824148, five 32768-entry tables built by 0x461830): 0xf8, 0xf9, 0xfa, 0xfb scale the screen pixel's 5-bit channels by 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8 (truncated), 0xfc adds 4 (to 31). Shadow FLCs use 0xf8..0xfb, the holemark sheet's green is 0xf8. The port draws black at 1/2, 3/8, 1/4, 1/8 (was 0.63 to 0.27 by the ramp's colour). Index 0xfe (in some cactus and palm FLCs) would read past the five tables in the exe; the port keeps its earlier reading. `sprites::load_sprite`, holemarks.rs |
| Pro panel club and lie | EXACT | 0x41b62f..0x41b7e6: "Club: " and the golfer's club byte (+0x1c, 0..11 as the aim picks it) through 0x40a9a0 (Driver, 3 Wood, 4 Wood, 2..9 Iron, Lob Wedge, Sand Wedge, Putter: the thoughts' table), "Lie: " and the terrain table name (+0x00) of the type under the ball (0x40bfa0), the static table's lower-case singular ("tees", "pot bunker"); the per-theme renaming of records is not decoded. `pro::club_label`, `pro::lie_name` |
| Water glints and bank rocks in the frame | EXACT order | The glints (0x411574) go straight onto the frame in the tile loop, before the queued sprites; the bank rocks are queued (0x462a30) and drawn with the sprites in order of their points' screen height, so a golfer in front of a bank covers its rocks and one behind is covered. `render.rs` draws the glints before the props and merges the rocks into the props' depth order (`App::bank_rock_quads`) |
| TV tower and booth | EXACT | 0x463180 cases 0x11 / 0x12: the static sprite 0x246 / 0x248 (frame 0, box 80 / 60) then the animated 0x247 / 0x249 one step nearer, frame (tick / 2 + 13 b + 7 a) mod 4n run up, held, down and held (`objects::tv_frame`), view (rot / 2 - dir - 1) & 3, palette 0xb3 |
| Sprite shadows | EXACT order | 0x43d740 composites NameShadow.flc under Name.flc into the same frames at load, so shadows are drawn with their sprite in depth order (a nearer sprite's shadow falls over a farther one), not in a pass of their own |

Tested headless only; not run on the Mac.

## Update 77 additions

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tournament reveal | PLACEHOLDER | After accepting, the results screen fills in hole by hole (0.7 s per hole) as a running leaderboard, then shows the final results; any key or click skips. The rounds are still computed up front, so this is a presentation of them, not live play on the course |
| Multi-slot saves | already present | Named save files and the Load screen list were already in place; the old gap entry was stale |

Tested headless only (a 7-hole reveal render); not run on the Mac.

Note (update 77): the pair-selection screen builder FUN_0044bde0 has no caller and no address reference anywhere in spec/golf_decomp.c, so its real trigger cannot be recovered from the decompile. The backquote key stays a PLACEHOLDER until another source shows it.

## Update 78 additions

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Golfer remarks in the world | DERIVED | Each accepted reaction floats its comment sentence (from the existing comment generator, coloured by polarity) above the golfer for 5 seconds; the position, size, duration and fade are my choices from the real screenshots. Shares the Shift+N toggle with name tags |

Soak check (update 78): an AddressSanitizer plus UBSan build ran headless through long hooked sessions (3000 simulated seconds on a new property with a match, practice round, tournament reveal, tutorial page, skills dialog) with no reports. Leak detection was off and no real mouse input was exercised.

## Update 79 additions

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Starting land | EXACT | Replaces the tract guess: the owned area is a centred square of tiles [k, 49-k] with k from the acres byte (FUN_00470a60: smallest k >= 1 with 4*(25-k)^2 <= acres*10); coastal leaves the y-low side open, islands are fully owned, sandbox owns tiles 1..48. Ownership is per tile; buying a tract takes the whole tract. Tract price and acres shown use the remaining unowned tile count. Which screen side is "y-low" for coastal is a weak reading. Saves write LAND 2 (k, lie); old saves keep their tract mask. Notes in DECODE_LAND.md |
| Voice emotion banks | EXACT ids, DERIVED shadowing | Type 1 plays Happy (Success when upset), types 2, 3, 8 play Sad (when upset the exe's Failure slots are shadowed by HARD/EASY/TRICKY/BLIND voices or the boing, played here). Male PLS, KLS, SSS use the exe's "PLS/MKLS/SSS ... mix" files; male PLS Sad is silent (the exe asks for a file that is not on the disc). "Upset" (exe flag 0x20000) is still a stand-in: the last reaction was bad |
| Types 12 and 13 | DERIVED | mWATER0 for men; women get the tree leaves effect (the exe's female slot is shadowed); 500 ms delay |
| Voice positioning | EXACT formulas, GUESSED units | Golfers off an 800 x 500 screen area are silent; pan = sx*127/800 - 64; volume byte = (|sx-400|>>4)+50 (the zoom subtraction is not applied, the port's zoom is another scale); pitch jitter 300 - rand(600) treated as cents; gain = volume/127*1.5. New Mixer::playAt (pan, pitch, delay) checked with a synthetic clip |
| Golfer card skills panel | EXACT rule | Drawn automatically for pros and the player's golfer, never for ordinary golfers; the S key toggle is gone (DECODE_CARDS3.md) |
| Golfer card Customize | weak reading | Live only on the player's own golfer, opens the character editor; View Story stays pale (its screen is not in the decompile) |

Not found in the decompile: the info card click handlers, the story screen, the Load panel class words. Tested headless only (start renders on two properties, a tract purchase, card render, synthetic mixer test, sanitizer soak); not run on the Mac.

## Update 80 fixes

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dock hover overlay | FIXED | The hover sprites on 3mainLowerLeft.pcx carry their own hard edged shadow, which was drawn over the shadow already baked into the dock, and the sprite was placed by its centre, a few pixels off. Hover now draws only the pixels that differ from the normal sprite (new ui::loadPcxHoverDiff) at the exact spot the normal sprite sits on the baked dock (found by matching the sheet cut against the dock art, kDockPos). Buttons 4 (zoom out) and 9 (tools) have no exact baked match, so they keep the whole sprite at the old position |

Checked headless on all dock buttons; the panel tab and player panel hovers were not changed and not re-verified with real mouse input.

Tool (update 80): `sgsprites <game dir> <output dir>` exports every Flics sprite to a PNG sheet (row per view, column per frame, shadows as _shadow). Palette variants are not applied.

## Tournament screens, second pass

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Live leader board | EXACT | 0x45a090: frame (0, 8, 144, 22 (H + 1) + 16), title tops 9 / 21 / 33, rows from 45 every 11, x 7 (x 1 from place 10), pro 0x23e8, prize not grouped, no shrinking; championship "at <course>". Footage p1 4700-6200 agrees (2 pixel registration error at the top of the screen) |
| Tournament results | EXACT | 0x45a090: row steps 26 / 18, names at x 25, hole columns by hole number, "F" = total strokes, prize "§n,000" in 0x1284, bands 2 pixels left and the header 10 up (trimmed sprite cuts). Footage p2 86-92 agrees |
| Recommendations list | EXACT (exe over footage) | 0x46d200: the TV towers' line is the first option (bit 0) and the towers and booths are placed only when it stays ticked; the footage's build shows no such line. Booth direction coin fixed (+2 on a non-zero coin) |
| Professional Tournament scorecard | EXACT | 0x461110 as before; a long name's smaller font no longer applies to its numbers. Test hook `--edit "g:2"` |
| Great-shot SimFoto | EXACT | 0x409620 / 0x407e00 (DECODE_TOURNAMENTS.md 9): the zoom and replay-record gate, the composed message, the photo's bounds, track and flight, border, caption and date, the message box at (150, top - 192) or below the photo, the click wait (F10 saves), the ticker fallback and the after-effects; footage p1 3001, 5161, 6158 agree (box frame at top - 156, the wrap word for word, the HUD hidden). Not ported: the pro's partner slot's skill table 0x5a5a14 |
| Message box height | EXACT | 0x40d320 takes 15 per line break (0x45af30 counts breaks) plus 0x20, with or without a speaker; footage strips p2 1120 / 1880 and the p1 3001 box agree |

## Dock panels and maps (October 2026)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Green button flag | EXACT | The loader (0x43d740, shadow argument 1) plays the Shadow.flc and then the body into one canvas, so the flag carries its shadow; the port draws the shadow sprite first at the same anchor. Position checked: canvas centre (240, 240) of the 80 x 60 cut at (200, 200) lands on (slot x + 31, slot y + 24), the port's anchor; footage p1 1600-1760 agrees within a pixel, so no y offset |
| People button | EXACT | 0x432720: mode 2 unless already 2 (then closed, 5); the Employee overlay flag 0x561254 is left alone. The port keeps the overlay's underlying mode (Golfers or Player): from the Employee panel over the Player panel People moves to mode 2 and the Employee panel stays; mode 3 (the pro's shot, 0x4289e0) clears the flag. Dock hover compares the raw mode, so People lights over the Player panel |
| Golfers list click | EXACT | 0x435680: the camera always goes to the golfer; the card (0x53df54) opens only when his screen x (+0x08, -1 off screen) is set or a card is open |
| Refused building (red silhouette) | EXACT | 0x462be0 queue flag 0x800 calls 0x474260 with colour 0x7c00 and strength 0xf8; jgl's tint blit (sprite +0x4c, 0x10009920 then 0x1000e920, decompiled with REA) makes every drawn pixel (index below 0xf8, not the key) half the sprite's 5-5-5 colour plus half the tint's, channel by channel with the low bits dropped; the strength is never read; with no palette given it keeps the sprite's stored one, or the library default, and draws nothing with neither. `cursor_ui::tint15` |
| Themed building names | EXACT | The theme loader 0x43dbe0 copies the theme's names over the object table's Snack Bar, Swim Club, Marina and Airstrip entries: Parkland Snack Bar, Tennis Court, Marina, Airstrip; Desert Snack Bar, Spa, Helipad, Casino; Tropical Snack Bar, Swim Club, Marina, Theme Park; Links Pub, Stable, Church, Castle. Every name read from the table follows (panel, hover box, unlock message, ledger, the Home Values "Building a ..." line); 0.5.12 showed the table's own Swim Club, Marina and Airstrip in every theme (issue #110). `land::building_name`, `land::set_name_theme` |
| Routing map flags | EXACT, DERIVED Desert/Tropical palette | Palette 0x60 + theme (the Parkland house palette, unloaded 0x61/0x62, the Links flag palette), not 0x63. An unloaded palette has a null data pointer and jgl's paletted blit (+0x78, 0x100098c0) only stores a palette it is given (sprite +0x10) before drawing with the stored one, so Desert and Tropical flags show the flag palette 0x63 the course's pins drew the same sprite in last. Half size through jgl's scaled blit (scale = num / den set by the renderer's +0x9c, 0x1003bce0; offsets moved by integer division in 0x4741b0, size (int)(w * k), source pixel floor(i / k), whole part of the scale added to the corner; 0x1000e920 and the plain blits alike), drawn crisp at those pixels by `draw_queued`; marker, line, number, line, flag drawn at once in that order (0x4628d0 draws straight away); shadows drawn. Tile colours were already exact. The G4 clip shows no yellow numbers and dark flags; the exe draws the numbers unconditionally and footage of the land map (p1 3120) shows them |
| Land map | EXACT | 0x4587a0 draws the routing map's tiles (tab used last, 2 px higher) and the same hole marks; tract numbers in 0x821f28 centred at (x - 7, y - 4) of tile (8, 8)'s routing point, only while the tract has land for sale; if that tile is not for sale the position is the previous tract's text origin (stale variables), its price line when that tract was for sale (two lines of 17, PLACEHOLDER pitch). Footage p1 3120 matches within a pixel |
| Employee Move work area | EXACT | The staff loop (0x403d87) draws, for the record in move mode (0x4c2e10), a 12 yard white ring round the employee while paused or when tick & 2 is set, then 0x407c60 round the tile under the pointer (0x430020): a radius of 4 tiles (100 yards), 6 for a Groundskeeper, 8 for a Lawn Technician (bit 8 at +0x12; the other skilled jobs keep 4), colour Soda Vendor 0x03ff, Groundskeeper 0x7ff0, Ranger 0x0018, Club Pro 0x6318. `cursor_ui::draw_staff_move` |
| Face strip under panels | EXACT, unchanged | The strip (0x418d09 in 0x40f5c0) is drawn before the dock and panel calls (0x432ba0 and the panel draws), hidden only in a tournament; panels cover it, as the port already did |

## Non-original options

| Option | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Enhanced graphics | NOT ORIGINAL, opt-in | The port's own drawing for large and wide screens (docs/ENHANCED.md): sharp text, premultiplied and mipmapped art, the HUD anchored to a wide window's edges, anisotropic filtering, MSAA, a smooth camera and smooth motion between ticks. Off by default; with it off every frame is byte-identical to Classic, and it never changes the simulation (zoom-dependent rules read the nearest original zoom level). Parity is always judged with Enhanced off |
| Course size | NOT ORIGINAL, opt-in | Large (74), Huge (98) and Giant (128 tiles a side) maps chosen on Select Difficulty (docs/PLAYING.md, "Course size"). Original (50 x 50) is the default; at that size the land, the simulation, the saves and every frame are byte-identical to the build before sizes (checked on new games, an 18-hole sandbox, the effects and the land screen). The larger sizes scale the generator, the deal, the tracts, the path search limits and fix the exe's distance bug (sg_core::mapsize). Parity is always judged at the Original size |
| HD graphics | NOT ORIGINAL, opt-in | The player's own upscaled art pack (docs/HD.md); Classic unchanged with it off |
| OpenSGolf extras | NOT ORIGINAL, on by default (additive) | People screen with golfer profiles and the pro's screens, message history, name tags under the pointer, tabs over the F1 to F10 reports, path view and Show buttons (docs/PLAYING.md "OpenSGolf extras"). Each only adds a screen, tag, strip or button and never changes the simulation; Preferences > *OpenSGolf extras...* has a tick each and `--no-extras` turns them off for a run. With them off every report, panel, menu and the course compare pixel for pixel with the build before them (the Preferences box gains its *OpenSGolf extras...* line). Parity is judged with `--no-extras` |
