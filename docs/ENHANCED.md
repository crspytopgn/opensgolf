# Enhanced graphics (optional, not in the original)

SimGolf was made for an 800×600 screen. On a 4K or ultrawide monitor the port scales that screen up, which keeps the
original's look but leaves soft text, soft interface art and a HUD bunched in the middle of a wide window. **Enhanced
graphics** is an opt-in way of drawing the same game for today's screens. It changes no art: everything is drawn from the
same files, only with different filtering, at the screen's own resolution, and placed for the window's shape.

Enhanced is **not** part of the original game and is not a parity feature (docs/PARITY.md): it is the port's own option, off by
default.

## The Classic guarantee

**Classic is the default and is never changed by Enhanced.** Every hook into the drawing code asks one of the switches in
`crates/simgolf/src/enhanced.rs` first (`native_text()`, `smooth_ui()`, `widescreen()`, ...), and all of them are false while the
master switch is off. With Enhanced off the game runs the code it ran before Enhanced existed and draws the same pixels:
this was checked by rendering the same eight scenes (800×600, 1280×800, 1600×900, 1920×1080, 3440×1440 and 3840×2160; the
course with and without panels, the title menu, the Course Report, the roster, a loaded game) with the build before
Enhanced and the build with it, and comparing the PNGs byte for byte. Switching Enhanced off in the game (or starting with
`--classic-render`) gives the classic frame again; the test that turns it off at run time and compares against a fresh
Classic run matched byte for byte too.

Enhanced never touches the simulation. Saves, the random generator and the game's rules are the same with it on or off.
The one place where a rule reads the camera is the zoom: the great-shot SimFoto, the thoughts and the like depend on the
original's three zoom levels. With Enhanced's continuous zoom those rules read the **nearest** original level
(`App::exe_zoom`), so a shot is still judged "at the closest zoom" exactly when the view is nearest that level.

Enhanced and HD (docs/HD.md) can be combined: HD replaces the art with the player's upscaled pack, Enhanced changes how it
is filtered, placed and animated.

## Turning it on

- **In the game:** System Functions → Preferences → the *Enhanced graphics* tick switches it on and off; *Enhanced graphics settings...* opens a checkbox list in five pages, picked with
  the tabs along its top (click or tap a tab; Left, Right or Tab on the keyboard): **Display** (the options below),
  **Effects** (the shader effects, cast shadows, the balls' trail and impacts, and the effects' quality), **Atmosphere**
  (sky, time of day, the day's length, evening lights, clouds, haze, water reflections, tilt-shift, grading and bloom) and
  **Weather** (rain, wet ground after it, lightning, mist, wind and the seasons) and **Water** (the water's colour, waves,
  shoreline, caustics, rain rings, life on the water, frozen ponds and spray; see *Water*). The box is wide enough for the
  five tabs. The master switch *Enhanced graphics (off:
  Classic)* heads every page. The box keeps one size whatever the page, so it fits an 800 × 600 window. Tick what you want
  (the quality line steps through low, medium and high on each click) and click the OK tick; what was ticked on every page
  is taken together, Esc forgets it all. The choice is saved in `settings.json` in the save folder, under `"enhanced"`:

  ```json
  "enhanced": { "enabled": true, "native_text": true, "smooth_ui": true, "widescreen": true,
                "terrain_filter": true, "msaa": true, "smooth_camera": true, "smooth_motion": true }
  ```

  Options that the textures carry (smooth interface art, sharper course textures) and the master switch make the art again
  when they change; the others take effect on the next frame.
- **Command line:** `--enhanced` turns the master switch on for one run, `--classic-render` turns it off (neither is saved;
  the options keep their saved values). `--classic` is the HD switch (docs/HD.md), not this one.
- **Test hook:** `--edit M:5` opens the Enhanced graphics screen, for stills (`M:5,1` on its Effects page, `M:5,2` on
  Atmosphere, `M:5,3` on Weather, `M:5,4` on Water).

## The options

| Option (settings key) | What it does |
|---|---|
| Sharp text at the screen's resolution (`native_text`) | Text is rasterised from the TrueType faces (Klepto, Manual SSi, Arial or its stand-in) at the size it really has on the screen (the size asked for times the window's scale), cached per face and pixel size, and drawn texel for pixel on whole pixels. The pen still advances by the classic metrics in 800×600 units, so line breaks, centring and every layout are unchanged. Classic bakes the faces once at 32 pixels and scales them. |
| Smooth interface art at any size (`smooth_ui`) | Interface pictures, sprites, portraits and HD pack pictures are uploaded with premultiplied alpha and mipmaps (trilinear). Scaled up or down, their edges blend with what is under them without the dark or magenta fringes that straight alpha leaves; drawn smaller (a phone, a small window, the far zoom) they do not shimmer. A texture made this way is drawn with a premultiplied blend state; every other texture keeps the classic one, so the two can be mixed safely. Colour-keyed pictures (all-or-nothing alpha: the dock, the title art, the theme icons, cursors, sprites) also lose their stair-stepped outlines on a large window (edges.rs): their alpha is replaced by the distance to a smoothed outline (an exact distance transform smoothed with a Gaussian, by at most half a texel, only where the shape is at least a few texels thick, never across a texel centre), and FRAGMENT_SDF in gfx.rs (or the pixel-art scaler, `pm` 2) turns it into coverage one screen pixel wide at whatever size the picture is drawn. Thin lines, single texels and one-texel gaps keep their width; the colours are untouched (only the outline is smoothed: jagged edges drawn inside the art's colours are the pixel-art scaler's job, its *Smooth* filter above all). |
| Widescreen: interface at the window's edges (`widescreen`) | On a window that is not 4:3 the course already fills the window; with this option the HUD goes to the window's edges too: the course badge in the top left corner, the rating pills in the top right, the dock, its panels and the face strip in the bottom left, the leader board top left, messages, the golfer card and *Paused* at the top centre, the aim box bottom right, the touch buttons on the right edge. Reports, dialogs and pop-ups stay centred. Full-screen pages (title screens, the trophy room, Tracts for Sale, the Routing Map, the pair chooser, Top 10, Customise) are pillarboxed: the bars get a dark green gradient (over the course, translucent so the course shows dimly) and a soft shadow along the page's edges. The pointer follows: each frame remembers the rectangles it drew and the shift each had, and a pointer over one of them is mapped back into that piece's own 800×600 layout, so every click and hover test of the game works unchanged. Tested at 16:9 (1920×1080, 3840×2160) and 21:9 (3440×1440). |
| Sharper course textures (`terrain_filter`) | The terrain's mipmapped textures get anisotropic filtering (up to 8×) where the driver has `GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic` (or OpenGL 4.6), so the course stays sharp towards the top of the screen at the steep viewing angle. Skipped in browsers and on phones (WebGL 1 / GLES 2 do not promise it) and wherever the driver does not know the setting. |
| Anti-aliasing (`msaa`) | The frame is drawn into a 4× multisampled target and resolved (the HD mode's target): smooth terrain edges, cliffs and lines. Desktop only, where the renderer can resolve multisampled targets. |
| Smooth camera: zoom, turns and panning (`smooth_camera`) | The mouse wheel and a two-finger pinch zoom continuously between the original's farthest and closest levels (a wheel notch is a quarter of a doubling); the zoom buttons and z / x still step to the next original level. Every zoom change is eased. A quarter turn (PageUp, Home, the dock's turn buttons, a twist) is animated instead of snapping; the sprites switch to the next view half way through. Arrow-key scrolls glide, and a dragged course keeps moving for a moment when let go. The rules keep the original's levels: see *The Classic guarantee*. |
| Photo mode (`photo_mode`) | Lets photo mode open (the C key or the camera button over the course): see *Photo mode* below. On by default. |
| Fix the original game's bugs (`fix_original_bugs`) | Not an Enhanced option: kept with these settings, but a line of Preferences itself (not in this box), and the master switch does not gate it, so Classic gets the fixes too. Fixes the original game's own bugs (docs/FIXES.md); off plays them as the original does. On by default. |
| Smooth motion between game ticks (`smooth_motion`) | The simulation runs in 87 ms ticks (about 11.5 a second) as the original does; the screen is drawn at the display's refresh rate (60 to 144 Hz, miniquad's swap interval 1). With this option golfers, staff, celebrity residents, animals, carts, the balloon, blimp, sailboat and birds, and the balls (their flight arcs too, without the original's whole-pixel height steps) are drawn between where they were at the last two ticks instead of jumping once a tick. Moves of more than two tiles in a tick (a golfer sent home, a new ball) are not smoothed. This is drawing only: the simulation, saves and tests are unchanged. It shows things one tick (87 ms) behind the simulation. |

## Effects

Shader effects on the course and on the art, in `crates/simgolf/src/fx.rs` (settings, light map, drawing) and
`crates/simgolf/src/fx_glsl.rs` (the shaders). None of them edits or replaces a picture: they read the classic art, the
decoded terrain light (`sg_core::terrain::Lighting`, `light_direction`) and the height field, and draw them differently.

### What each effect does

| Option (key) | Default with Enhanced | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Pixel-art scaling (`scaler`) | smooth | Sprites and interface pictures that are drawn larger than their pixels (an 800 × 600 game on a 4K screen is magnified 3.6 times) go through a scaler instead of plain bilinear blur, with one of three filters. **Sharp bilinear** keeps every art pixel crisp and blends only a one-screen-pixel seam between them. **Edge-directed** is an xBR-style filter (levels 1 and 2: 45° and the shallow / steep 30° edges, evaluated for the four corners of each texel from its 5 × 5 neighbourhood) on a softened sharp-bilinear base: outlines and diagonals become smooth lines instead of stair steps where the art has runs of equal colours. **Smooth (strongest)**, the default, follows the art's own edges (see *The Smooth scaler* below): the stair steps inside the art too (the dock's rings, plus and minus, turn arrows, the diagonal lines of the badges and frames, flag poles, railings, roof edges) become smooth lines at any magnification, while flat areas, soft shading and textured art keep the softened sharp-bilinear look. Colours are compared and mixed premultiplied, so the colour-keyed transparent pixels count as one colour whatever RGB they hide and sprite outlines get smooth, fringe-free edges. Text is left alone (the font atlases are marked plain), so are pictures that are not magnified (HD pack art, far zooms). |
| Animated water (`water`) | on | Water tiles get their own shader: travelling waves bent by noise perturb the normal; the surface reflects the theme's sky (pale low down, the deeper colour only on slopes turned up), and facets the waves turn towards the decoded light's half vector glint. Shallow water foams in drifting bands along the shore (from a signed distance to the land, at the light map's resolution). The theme's own water textures stay the base, desert water swap included; where an edge piece shows its bank (rocks, grass, sand), the effects fade out by comparing each pixel with the texture's own middle colour, so the bank art is untouched. The decoded ripple, rock, dolphin, fountain and waterfall sprites still draw on top. |
| Per-pixel terrain light (`lighting`) | on | The decoded light model (Terrain.dll's light 0, the theme's `Lighting.txt` colours, OpenGL's default material, specular 13, the port's brightness calibration) computed per pixel instead of per vertex. Same colours, smoother highlights. The ground is lit with its smooth normal: the corner grid's normals (central differences of the heights) spread bilinearly, baked into the detail map (see *After the rain*), so a gently tilted tile no longer shows as a square of its own shade with hard edges, as the meshes' flat faces do in the classic light (walls and cliffs keep their own normals). |
| Ambient occlusion (`occlusion`) | on | Baked per vertex of the tile meshes' 3 × 3 grid from the height field: how much of the horizon the point sees in eight directions, plus how far it sits below the ground around it (valley floors darker). Spread to the light map bilinearly and applied to the ambient and direct light. |
| Soft terrain shadows (`shadows`) | on | A height-field shadow pass: from every light-map texel a ray marches towards the decoded light (in world space: the eye-space light turned back by the view, 25° above the horizon) over the heights, keeping the smallest clearance over distance, which gives a penumbra that widens with the distance to the caster. Shadowed ground keeps 38% of its direct light. The game's hills are gentle, so the shadows are mostly a soft darkening behind ridges and below raised ground. |
| Soft sprite shadows (`sprite-shadows`) | on | The art's own shadow frames (`*Shadow.flc`, drawn under buildings, trees and people) are blurred by a small Gaussian so their edges fade into the ground. No shadow is invented where the art has none. Off in HD (the pack's frames are used as they are). |
| Sky (`sky`) | on | Instead of the classic black beyond the property and below its cliff, a gradient from the theme's sky through a haze at mid screen to the haze below the map. Classic keeps its black. |
| Tilt-shift (`tilt-shift`) | off | Depth of field by screen height: the course is sharp in a band through the middle of the screen and blurs towards the top and bottom, a "miniature" look. |
| Colour grading (`grading`) | on | Gentle contrast and vibrance (saturates the dull colours more than the vivid ones) and a slight tint, per theme: neutral parkland, warm desert, clear tropical, cool links. |
| Bloom (`bloom`) | on | The brightest parts (sparkle, white sand, highlights) glow a little: a bright pass, blurred at a quarter (high quality: half) of the resolution, added back. |
| Vignette (`vignette`) | on | Slightly darker screen corners. |
| Cast shadows (`cast-shadows`) | on | Sprites cast their own outline along the sun onto the ground (see *Cast shadows* below). |
| Time of day (`time-of-day`) | off | Morning, midday, golden hour, sunset and a short blue dusk, one day of light per game month (see *Time of day and weather*). |
| Cloud shadows (`clouds`) | on | Soft cloud shadows drift over the course and dim the sprites under them. |
| Distance haze (`haze`) | on | The far (upper) part of the view pales towards the sky's horizon colour, more when zoomed out. |
| Rain (`rain`) | off | Light rain on some days (the same days for a save), with greyer, dimmer light and faint shadows. |
| Mist (`mist`) | off | Mist pooling in hollows, low ground and over water: thick at dawn and gone by late morning with the time of day, a light veil all day without it. |
| Ball trail (`ball-trail`) | on | A soft trail fading behind a ball in the air. |
| Ball impacts (`ball-impacts`) | on | Where a ball comes down: a puff of sand in a bunker, rings and drops on water, a flick of grass elsewhere. |
| Day length (`day-length`) | normal | How long a day of light lasts: short (one game month, the first versions' pace), normal (three) or long (six); see *Time of day and weather*. |
| Water reflections (`reflections`) | on | Trees, buildings and golfers mirrored in the water, rippling; stronger sun glitter at golden hour; the water lapping at the shore (see *Water reflections*). |
| Wind (`wind`) | on | A wind for each day: trees, palms, bushes and grasses sway, flags fly downwind, the rain and the clouds follow it (see *Wind*). |
| Evening lights (`evening-lights`) | on | With the time of day: lit windows, lamps with pools of light and fireflies at dusk (see *Evening lights*). |
| Seasons (`seasons`) | on | Blossom and fresh greens in spring, autumn colours in September and October, frost and dew on spring and autumn mornings (see *Seasons*). |
| After the rain (`after-rain`) | on | With rain: wet, glossy ground and puddles during and after a rainy day, now and then a rainbow (see *After the rain*). |
| Grass tufts (`grass`) | on | Tiny tufts of grass, a few pixels at the art's own pixel size, standing up from the rough and the deep rough and swaying in the wind; none on fairways, greens or tees. Only at the closest zoom level. |
| Lightning (`lightning`) | off | Flashes and distant flicker in heavy rain where the climate is wet (see *Climate*), never in the desert. |
| Heat waves (`heat`) | off | On a desert course's hot summer days: a warm, bleached light through the midday hours, a warm heat haze over the distance, and on the hottest days parched, straw-tinted grass that greens again once the heat breaks (see *Heat waves*). |
| Sharpen (`sharpen`) | on | Contrast-adaptive sharpening of the finished picture: the art's own detail (the grass, the trees' leaves, the roofs) comes out crisper on large screens, strongest where the picture is soft and never past its own colours, so no halos. Desktop only, with the other post-processing. |
| Winter (`winter`) | on | The first days of March on parkland and links courses: full morning frost, snow showers instead of rain, and some mornings a light dusting that melts by mid-morning (see *Winter*). |
| Tournament crowds (`crowds`) | on | During a tournament or a championship, spectators (the game's own golfer sprites) round the greens and along the fairways of the holes in play, cheering now and then (see *Tournament atmosphere*). |
| Life on the course (`life`) | on | Flocks of birds crossing the sky with their shadows, butterflies over flower beds in summer, leaves falling from the trees in autumn (see *Life on the course*). |
| Truer water colour (`water-colour`) | on | The theme's own water colour kept as the base and tinted by the distance from the shore: lighter (and, where the art is a deep blue, more turquoise) in the shallows, a deeper blue out in the middle, a little brighter and richer. The sky is mirrored as a brighter wash of the water's own colour, weaker, so the water no longer goes grey, and part of the distance haze is made up for so a lake keeps its blue at the top of the screen (see *Water*). |
| Painterly waves (`waves`) | on | Soft crescents of light lying across the wind, a little darker behind, swelling, drifting downwind and fading, about 28 art pixels across at any zoom: their strength follows the day's wind and the weather (glassy at dawn and dusk with the time of day, choppy in a storm). |
| Shoreline (`shoreline`) | on | Two lines of water lapping in and out along the shore (the near one bright), a wet sheen behind them, and the bank's own sand and grass a little darker in a narrow uneven band where the water wets it. |
| Caustics (`caustics`) | on | Sunlight rippling in a web over the bottom of shallow water, fading with cloud shadows, rain, dusk and night. |
| Rain rings (`rain-rings`) | on | With *Rain*: rings opening across the surface where drops fall, more of them the harder it rains. |
| Life on the water (`water-life`) | on | Reeds at the edges of ponds and lakes, lily pads in their sheltered shallows, ducks and swans gliding on the larger lakes, and now and then a fish jumping, all as crisp pixels (see *Water*). |
| Frozen ponds (`ice`) | on | With *Winter*: in the late-winter cold snap, small ponds ice over (pale, see-through ice with cracks, clear patches and a sheen) and larger water gets a thin, broken rim of ice at its edges, thawing with the snow. |
| Fountain and waterfall spray (`spray`) | on | Foam churning, drops falling back and rings spreading round the original's fountains, foam and rings at the foot of its waterfalls. |
| Quality (`quality`) | medium | Low: light map 2 texels a tile, no blur passes (no tilt-shift, no bloom), sharp-bilinear scaling only, the cast shadows' mask at half the resolution. Medium: 4 texels a tile, blurs at a quarter of the resolution, the mask at half. High: 8 texels a tile, blurs at half the resolution, the mask at full. On the Effects page since this version. |

The post-processing (tilt-shift, grading, bloom, vignette) draws the course into an offscreen target, then composites it
into the frame; the interface (dock, panels, text, screens over the course) is drawn after that and is not affected.
With HD or Enhanced's anti-aliasing on, that offscreen course keeps the 4× multisampling. The scaler also handles the
premultiplied textures of Enhanced's *smooth interface art* (it blends them premultiplied).

### Turning it on

The effects are part of Enhanced graphics: with the master switch on, System Functions → Preferences → *Enhanced
graphics...* has a tick for each (stored in `settings.json` under `"enhanced"` as `fx_scaler`, `fx_scaler_mode` (the
filter: 0 sharp bilinear, 1 edge-directed, 2 smooth; a line that steps through them; an older file's `fx_scaler_sharp`
still picks sharp bilinear until the filter is chosen again),
`fx_water`, `fx_terrain_light`, `fx_sprite_shadows`, `fx_sky`, `fx_tilt_shift`, `fx_grading`, `fx_bloom`, `fx_quality`
(0 to 2), `fx_cast_shadows`, `fx_ball_trail`, `fx_ball_impacts`, `fx_clouds`, `fx_haze`, `fx_time_of_day`, `fx_rain`,
`fx_mist`, `fx_reflections`, `fx_wind`, `fx_evening_lights`, `fx_seasons`, `fx_after_rain`, `fx_lightning`, `fx_heat`,
`fx_day_length` (0 to 2, default 1), `fx_water_colour`, `fx_waves`, `fx_shoreline`, `fx_caustics`, `fx_rain_rings`,
`fx_water_life`, `fx_ice`, `fx_spray`), all on but tilt-shift, lightning, heat waves, and the three that change the mood most: time of
day, rain and mist; the scaler's filter is *Smooth (strongest)*. The ticks map onto `fx::FxSettings` (`fx::sync`): *terrain light*
stands for per-pixel light, occlusion and shadows, *colour grading* for grading and vignette.

Finer control and tests, for one run:

- `--fx` turns the effects on (alone, without the rest of Enhanced) with the defaults above; `--fx-set LIST` also sets
  options, a comma separated list of `key=value` (value: `on` / `off`, a choice's number, or `sharp`, `edge`, `smooth`, `low`,
  `medium`, `high`), for example `--fx-set scaler=sharp,tilt-shift=on,quality=high`; the keys are those of the table above;
- otherwise the environment variable `OPENSGOLF_FX` (`1`, or a list as above);
- `--fx-list` prints the options, their labels and choices (`fx::options()`: key, label, choices, get, set).

### How Classic stays the same

Every hook is behind `fx::active()`, false unless the effects were turned on:

- `enhanced.rs`: the Preferences ticks and their settings fields; `apply_enhanced` hands them to `fx` (`App::fx_set`).
- `gfx.rs`: `Gfx::flush` asks `fx::apply_scaler` to draw a flat batch only when the scaler is wanted; otherwise the classic
  pipeline. `Gfx` holds the effects' pipelines (`fx`, None until used) and gained `draw_mesh_with` for them.
- `render.rs`: `render_world` calls `fx_draw_ground` instead of its three classic loops (terrain, walls, paths) when active;
  `draw_props` swaps a shadow frame for its softened copy when active.
- `app.rs`: `rebuild_batches` sets the water triangles apart and builds the light map only when active.
- `main.rs`: `draw_frame` moves the course offscreen and composites it only when post-processing is on.
- `ui.rs`: the font atlases are marked as text for the scaler (no effect on drawing).
- `render.rs`: `draw_props` draws the cast shadows after the ground overlays, tints a sprite (`fx_sprite_tint`, None unless
  the time of day, rain or clouds are on) and leaves out the art's shadow frames while the cast shadows replace them;
  `render_world` draws the haze and rain over the course; `draw_balls` draws the trails before the balls and the impacts
  after them. The view a prop's sprite is drawn in moved into `App::prop_view` (the same code, shared with the shadows).
- `app.rs`: `step_game` lets `fx_ball_tick` read each ball after a simulation tick (it writes nothing back).
- `main.rs`: `fx_world_begin` is told the frame's pass (the cast shadows draw their mask offscreen and come back to it).

The time of day, weather and ball effects were checked the same way: Classic scenes and Enhanced scenes with the new
options off, rendered with the build before them and with them, compared byte for byte (15 scenes: four themes, 800 × 600
to 3840 × 2160, a rotated view, a panel, a played save at two moments, the menu, a report, five Enhanced scenes): all
identical.

The reflections, wind, evening lights, seasons, after-the-rain, lightning and day length options, and the ground's smooth
normals, were checked the same way: 17 scenes (the ten Classic scenes above, five Enhanced scenes, one at dusk with the
time of day and mist, one in rain) rendered with the build before them and with them, the new options off (the day length
short) and `SG_FX_FACETED=1`: all identical. Their hooks: `render.rs` `draw_props` asks `fx_sprite_extras` (the season's
texture, the wind's bend, the windows' glow) for each body, draws the light pools after the cast shadows and the lamps in
the sprites' order; `fx_light.rs` `fx_overlay` draws the rainbow, fireflies and lightning; `fx.rs` `fx_draw_ground` draws
the reflections' target first and hands the water and terrain shaders the detail map, the reflections and three uniform
vectors that are 0 (their code skipped) while the options are off.

Checked by rendering the same scenes with the branch before the effects and with them off (four themes at 3840 × 2160,
1920 × 1080, 1280 × 1024 and 800 × 600, a rotated view, a panel open, a played save, the title menu and a report) and
comparing the PNGs: all identical.

The water options (OpenSGolf 0.4) were checked the same way: Classic scenes (the demo course in the desert and tropical
themes, three properties with water at 1280 × 800, 1920 × 1080 and 3840 × 2160, one in a turned view) rendered with the
build before them and with them are identical (scenes whose classic frame already differs from run to run, as the water's
glints do at the closest zoom, were left out). Their
hooks: `render.rs` `render_world` calls `fx_water_life` after the grass tufts; the rest is inside the effects (the water
and terrain shaders' unused uniform slots, the light map's shore distance). With Enhanced on and the new options off the
water differs from before only by the light map's coarser shore distance (on average a third of a level in 255).

### Browser and old GPUs

All shaders are GLSL ES 1.00 (WebGL 1 / GLES 2): no derivatives, no dynamic loops, highp in fragment shaders only where
`GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH` is defined, uniforms shared by both stages declared with the same precision. The
post-processing needs a depth buffer in an offscreen target, which the browser build does not get, so in the browser it
is skipped (tilt-shift, grading, bloom, vignette); the scaler, water, light, shadows and sky still run there, and so do
the cast shadows (their mask is a colour target without depth), the time of day, clouds (a 128 × 128 repeating noise:
a power of two, as WebGL 1 wants for repeating), haze, rain, mist and the ball effects, and the newer reflections (a colour
target without depth, sampled with `gl_FragCoord`), wind, evening lights, seasons, wet ground and lightning (the terrain
shader stays within WebGL 1's sixteen fragment uniform vectors and five textures). The cloud drift is kept within one
period of the noise so the shader's coordinates stay small where fragment shaders only have mediump. The light
map is built on the CPU (a few milliseconds; threaded on desktop) when the ground's heights, water or the view's turn
change, not every frame.

### The Smooth scaler

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_smooth.rs`, the scaler's third filter and the default. The game's art is pre-rendered and already
anti-aliased: lines and rings are drawn with in-between colours and the sprites are softly shaded, so the edge-directed
filter's rules, which look for runs of equal colours, rarely fire inside the art, and the stair steps of its rings, arrows
and diagonals stay. The Smooth filter measures the direction of the art's edges instead and interpolates along them
(steering kernel regression):

1. the 4 × 4 texels around the pixel are read once (16 fetches, premultiplied, the colour key taken as transparent);
2. the brightness gradients of the nine 2 × 2 blocks among them, weighted by a Gaussian around the pixel, give a
   structure tensor: its main axis is the edge's normal, `(l1 - l2) / (l1 + l2)` how clearly there is one edge (corners,
   dots and the noise of foliage or roof tiles have none) and `l1` how strong it is;
3. the texels are weighted by a Gaussian 1.2 texels long along the edge and 0.35 across it, so a stair-stepped circle, a
   shallow curve or a one-texel line becomes a smooth line, with no preferred angle (xBR knows 45° and 30°);
4. the same kernel half a texel to either side of the pixel gives the edge's two colours, and the pixel's place between
   them is steepened to a transition about one screen pixel wide: crisp without overshoot or halos. Not where the three
   are out of order (the middle of a thin line), lie on a straight ramp (soft shading), or differ little (the steps of
   the art's quantised gradients, which would turn into contour bands);
5. the result is mixed with the softened sharp-bilinear base (the edge-directed filter's) by the edge measure of 2, so
   flat areas, shading, textures and single-texel details stay as the art drew them instead of turning plastic.

Transparent edges: colour-keyed pictures keep the outline of the smooth interface art (edges.rs, the distance field,
one screen pixel wide) and take their colour from this filter, unpremultiplied, so no key colour or dark fringe shows;
premultiplied pictures (portraits, shadows) and straight ones get their alpha from the filter itself. It works at any
magnification from 1.2 (below that, and on quality low, the sharp filter draws), since it interpolates rather than
deciding per texel corner. GLSL ES 1.00 as the others: no texelFetch, no loops, the exponentials clamped so mediump
cannot underflow. The constants (kernel widths, thresholds) are at the top of the file.

Checked on the dock, the rating icons, the course badge, the Course Report, Tracts for Sale, the course sprites
(clubhouses, trees, cacti, the flag, golfers) at 1920 × 1080 and 3840 × 2160 against the edge-directed filter, crops
magnified 2 to 5 times. Known limits: on the dark rims of the rating icons, whose art has several close shades, the
filter leaves faint streaks along the rim at 5× and more; foliage and roof textures stay as crisp as sharp bilinear
(the filter does not invent smoothness where the art has no edge). Classic (1920 × 1080, and a report at 3840 × 2160) and
Enhanced with the edge-directed (3840 × 2160) or sharp (1920 × 1080) filter were rendered with the build before this
filter and with it and compared byte for byte: identical. The browser build (headless Chromium, SwiftShader WebGL) runs
it without errors.

### Cast shadows

Every standing sprite (trees, buildings, flags, people, animals; not ground overlays such as building bases and flower
beds, not the water's own sprites) can cast its outline onto the ground. The outline is the sprite's frame read as a
shape: padded, and blurred more the higher a row is above the sprite's ground point (a penumbra that widens away from the
base), cached per frame. It is drawn as two quads lying on the ground: the part of the picture above the ground point is
sheared along the shadow's direction (a point *c* up the picture stands *c* / (the eye's up axis' height) above the ground,
and its shadow lies that height times the shadow's length away), the part below it (a building's front step, a tree's
roots) stays where it is on the ground. A flier's shadow is carried away by its height. The outlines go into a mask (a
render target at half the screen's size, white, darkened under each outline, so overlapping shadows do not darken the
ground twice), which a full-screen pass multiplies into the frame with a cool shade colour, after the ground and its
overlays and before any sprite, and only where ground was drawn (its quad sits at the far end of the depth range with
the test "greater", so the sky and the black beyond the map are left alone).

**Why the art's shadows stay.** The art has pre-rendered shadow frames (`*Shadow.flc`) for nearly every tree, building and
person, rendered with the sprites in 3D: they are the right shape for the object's depth, which a 2D outline is not. So
with the sun where the art was lit (the time of day off) the art's shadows are kept, softened by *Soft sprite shadows*,
and only sprites without one cast an outline (pins and flags, tee markers, some decorations and props, the birds). The
cast shadows follow the art's shadows: measured on the tree and building frames, those fall to the right on the screen
and a little up it, about two thirds of the height of what casts them, and the outlines are laid the same way, so the two
kinds look alike side by side. With the time of day on the sun moves and the art's shadows would point the wrong way:
then the art's shadow frames are not drawn and every sprite casts its outline, turning and stretching with the sun (up to
2.4 times the height near sunset) and fading at dusk.

### Time of day and weather

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_light.rs`. A day of light lasts three game months (3 × 1024 ticks, about four and a half minutes
at normal speed) with the *Day length* at normal; short makes it one month (the first versions' pace, about 90 seconds)
and long six. It is read from the game's calendar tick (and the tick's fraction, so it moves smoothly); a new game opens in the morning. Key
moments: dawn, morning, a long midday that is exactly the classic decoded light, a golden afternoon, sunset and a short
blue dusk, blended with a smooth step. Each moment turns the sun round the vertical from the decoded light's direction
and sets its height, multiplies the decoded light's diffuse, specular and ambient colours, tints the pre-lit sprites, and
moves the sky's colours. The sun swings round the front of the view (from the left in the morning to the right at
sunset), so shadows lengthen sideways and away from the viewer. A low sun's light is raised so flat ground keeps at least
three quarters of its midday brightness; dusk keeps a cool light from above with no shadows. The terrain's light map is
marched towards the moving sun again when it has turned 3° or risen 2° (a few milliseconds, threaded). The water reflects
the moment's sky, the post-processing's backdrop takes the moment's haze.

Rain falls as often as the property's climate says (see *Climate*), more or less from one year to the next. Which days is a hash of
the course's name and size and the day: render-side only, the same days whenever the save is loaded, and the game's own
random generator is never used. With the normal or long day length the rain, the cloud cover and the wind blend with the
neighbouring day's over the first and last eighth of each day (half way at the boundary), so a spell of rain comes and
goes gently, and the clouds' drift is carried on from frame to frame (`FxWorld::cloud_acc`) so a change of wind turns
them instead of moving them; the short day length keeps the first versions' changes at the day's boundary. A wet day
dims the sun by half, greys the sky and the colours, fades the shadows, thickens
the clouds and the haze; the drops are thin slanted streaks drawn over the course (about 700 at 1920 × 1080, scaled with
the window), each landing in a small ring.

Clouds are a 128 × 128 repeating fractal noise (the same every run), laid over the course every 26 tiles and drifting at
about 0.6 tiles a second in a direction and cover that change from day to day. In the ground's shader they dim the sun's
part of the light; a sprite under one is dimmed on the CPU from the same noise (and its art shadow faded), so the two
agree. Mist mixes the ground towards a pale sky colour by how low it lies (below the lowest quarter of the course's
heights), how hollow it is (the ambient occlusion) and whether it is water, broken up by the drifting noise. Haze is a
gradient over the upper part of the view in the sky's horizon colour, stronger the more of the course the view takes in.

### Water reflections

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_reflect.rs`. Before the ground is drawn, every standing sprite within four tiles of water (not the
water's own sprites) is drawn mirrored into a render target (half the frame's size; a third at low quality, full at high):
an upright object's mirror image is its own picture flipped on the screen about the reflection of its ground point in
the water's plane (the nearest water's height), so each sprite is drawn flipped there, bending with the wind as the
sprite does, a little darker and fading towards its top. The water shader samples that target at its own pixel moved by
the waves' slope, so the reflections ripple and only show on the water itself (not on the bank art, which the water
shader already tells apart). Objects in front of the water mirror onto the land in front of them, as in life, so the
reflections show where the trees and buildings stand behind the water from the camera. The same option makes the glints
up to 2.8 times stronger as the sun gets low and warm (golden hour) and draws a thin line of water lapping in and out at
the shore, with the wet sheen behind it. The pixel-art scaler is held off for the reflections' pass (`fx::pause_scaler`).

### Water

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_water.rs` and the water shader (`fx_glsl.rs`, `water_fs`), the port's own: the options on the
*Water* page. They keep to the original's painterly, bright water: the theme's own water textures (the desert's swap
included) stay the base, and the bank art drawn into the edge pieces is told apart by its colour as before, so the
effects stay off it (only the shoreline's wet band darkens it, faintly, next to the water).

- **Colour with depth.** The light map's signed distance to the shore (`b`) now reaches three tiles each way (it reached
  one), so the shader knows how far out a pixel is: the shallows are lighter and the middle deeper. The original's water
  textures already show the depth by tile (shallow, middle, deep pieces); the tint follows the same idea smoothly. The
  older reflection mixed the theme's pale horizon colour over all the water, which made it grey; the distance haze then
  paled it further towards the top of the screen. Now the reflected sky is the water's own colour brightened, with a
  little of the sky's, and the water shader makes up for 60% of the haze that `fx_overlay` will draw over it (by screen
  height, as the haze grows), so lakes keep their blue up the screen while the land still recedes.
- **Waves.** Each wave cell (aligned with the wind) now and then shows a short bent crescent of light across the wind
  with a slightly darker trough behind it: a painter's dab, not fine noise. Their size is set in the art's pixels, so they
  read the same at every zoom. The strength is `wave_strength`: the day's wind (a middling breeze without *Wind*), times a
  calm at dawn and dusk with *Time of day*, plus a little for rain; fewer crests on calm water. The older travelling waves
  still bend the reflections and the glints, more in a stronger wind.
- **Shoreline.** Two lapping lines from the shore distance (the second fainter and further out), a sheen behind them, the
  bank pixels of the edge pieces darker near the water and, in the terrain shader, a narrow uneven darker band on the land
  side (light map `b` below 0.5, within about a sixth of a tile).
- **Caustics** are two drifting noises compared, bright where they cross, in water less than about a tile and a half from
  the shore, scaled by how sunny it is (the sun's shadow strength, no rain, not night) and the cloud shadows.
- **Rain rings**: three staggered layers of cells, each now and then dropping a ring that opens and fades; the share of
  cells that do is the rain's strength.
- **Life on the water** is drawn on the ground under the sprites (as the grass tufts are), at the art's pixel size as the
  view draws it (one to one at the exe's closest zoom, magnified with Enhanced's closer smooth zoom), from the closest
  zoom but one in. The course's bodies of water are found when the ground changes (`build_ponds`: 4-connected water,
  each tile's distance from the land); a body of 450 tiles or more, or of 150 running off the map, is the sea: none of
  this on it (a river running off the map is not the sea). Reeds stand in about a third of the shore tiles of ponds and
  lakes, on the bank side, swaying with the wind, bulrush heads from June (papyrus tufts in the desert), browner in
  autumn. Lily pads lie in some of the tiles one or two from the land from late April to October, a few flowers in high
  summer. Ducks (drakes and ducks, ducklings in May and June) and, except in the tropics, swans glide in slow ovals on
  open water (two tiles from the land and the property's edge) of lakes of 24 tiles or more, one group for every 40
  tiles up to four, with a faint wake; never in the desert's oases, not in the dark. A fish jumps on a body of 6 tiles or
  more now and then (a chance every 7 seconds): up and back with a splash each way and two rings spreading; not under
  ice, in heavy rain or in the dark. Everything comes from hashes of the course, the tile and the effects' clock, so it is
  the same every frame and every run.
- **Frozen ponds**: `Atmos::ice` (fx_winter.rs) is the cold snap's strength times the snow lying and falling, so it
  comes and goes with the snow and never happens where the climate has no snow. A pond up to about three tiles across
  (marked in the light map's alpha, fx.rs `small_ponds`) freezes over from its shore inwards, up to 1.6 tiles; a larger
  water gets a thin rim, under half a tile, with a notched edge, a few loose plates beyond it and a broken lip of light.
  The ice is see-through, whiter towards the bank, with patches of clear dark ice and of dusted snow, a broad sheen and a
  few wandering cracks. Under the ice there are no waves, glints, reflections, caustics or rain rings, and the ducks stay
  on open water.
- **Spray**: round each fountain (where wild_ui.rs puts the theme's spray sprite) foam pixels flicker in steps as the
  art's frames do, drops fall back round the jet and two rings spread; at each waterfall's spray (sprites 0x23b, 0x23c,
  placed as wild_ui.rs places them) foam churns round its foot, outside the sprite, and rings spread over the pool below.

The water shader takes the new settings in uniform slots it did not use, so it stays within WebGL 1's sixteen fragment
uniform vectors: `fx1` (rain rings, waves, ice, caustics), `params.w` (the wind's heading), `fx3.w` (the waves' size,
negative while the truer colour is off), `water.w` (the haze to make up for; the foam's 0.55 is now a constant) and
`fx3.z` 2 for the shoreline (1 is the reflections' older lapping line, which the shoreline replaces). Test hooks: the
weather ones above (`SG_FX_HOUR`, `SG_FX_WIND`, `SG_FX_RAIN`, `SG_FX_MONTH`, `SG_FX_SNOW`); `SG_FX_FISH=P` holds a fish on every
lake at that point (0 to 1) of its jump and rings; `SG_FX_LOG=1` also prints the
bodies of water (tiles, sea or not) and where the fountains and waterfalls are, for framing stills with `--center`.

### Wind

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_nature.rs`. Each day has a wind: its direction and strength (calm to a strong breeze, windier when
it rains) from the course's hash and the day. Gusts run across the course along it (value noise in time and in distance
along the wind). Sprites are told apart by their files (`kind_of`: deciduous and flowering trees, conifers, palms,
cacti, bushes, grasses and reeds, flags, buildings). Trees, palms, bushes and grasses lean downwind and sway (each with
its own frequency and phase, palms and grasses more, conifers less, cacti and buildings not at all): the sprite is drawn
as five strips whose corners move along the screen's right by the bend at their height (height^curve), so the ground
point stays and the top moves most (`strips`). Flags fly downwind: the art's flag points right of its pole in every
view, so it is mirrored about the pole when the wind blows to the screen's left. The rain's streaks slant with the wind's
part across the screen and the clouds drift along it, faster in a stronger wind. Only the drawn corners move (a few
pixels): the drawing order, the hit tests and the simulation are untouched.

### Evening lights

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_night.rs`, with the time of day only. From sunset (phase 0.84 to 0.935) to just after dawn:

- **Windows.** A building frame's windows are found in its art: dark, neutral or bluish pixels (glass) with light, low
  saturated pixels (frames, walls) within three pixels on both sides or round a corner, gathered into small compact
  patches (at most 80 pixels and 16 across, at least 40% of their box filled, so roof edges and dark trim are not
  taken), plus turquoise stained glass. About four windows in five are lit (a hash of the window), each a slightly
  different warm white, with a soft orange halo; the glow is cached per frame and drawn over the building (the bloom
  picks it up on the desktop).
- **Lamps.** A slim post with a glowing head and a halo beside the two outer corners (on the screen) of each building and
  every few tiles along the paths (a hash keeps them at least two tiles apart), drawn in the sprites' order; a pool of
  warm light on the ground under each, and a wider glow round each building.
- **Lamp posts** of the Path styles and lamps extra (docs/PLAYING.md; crates/simgolf/src/paths_lamps.rs): the lantern
  lights warm with a halo, and a wider, brighter pool of light than the automatic lamps' lies round each post. The pools
  go into the same pass and draw call as the other pools (two soft quads a post), so they cost next to nothing.
- **Fireflies.** On parkland and tropical courses, at dusk and more in summer (with the seasons), a few on some tiles of
  rough, brush, woods, marsh and within reach of water: green-gold lights drifting slowly a little above the ground,
  glowing up and fading.

### Seasons

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_nature.rs` and the terrain shader. The game's eight months, March to October, read from the
calendar tick (`SG_FX_MONTH` for stills). Spring (March, April, fading through May): deciduous trees freshen (their
greens a little yellower and brighter) and blossom (pink or white flecks in small clusters, shaded by the leaf they sit
on; flowering trees such as dogwood, peach and plum are full of it); conifers freshen half as much; the grass is a
fresher green. Summer: the art as it is. Autumn (from mid September, full in October): deciduous leaves turn a few at a
time (each pixel by its own hash) to red, orange or gold, darker leaves redder, the hue range differing between kinds of
tree; the grass turns a little golden. Palms and cacti do not change. The trees are recoloured copies of their frames
(foliage picked by hue, 48° to 178°), made when the season moves on by an eighth and cached; the grass is tinted in the
terrain shader (green pixels of grassy ground only). Per theme: no autumn or blossom in the tropics, little in the
desert, a little less on the links. With the time of day, early mornings in March, April and October have frost lying
in patches (more in hollows) and, in spring and autumn, dew or rime glinting in the sun (tiny twinkling sparkles, on
level ground only).

### After the rain

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_wet.rs` and the terrain shader, with rain on. During a rainy day the ground gets wet (darker by up
to a quarter, a little of the sky's colour in it) and puddles fill; through the next day it dries and the puddles shrink
away. Where puddles gather is the **detail map** (made with the light map, 8 texels a tile, 4 at low quality): the
potential of each spot, high on level fairway and rough (and tees and greens less), more in hollows, broken into blobs by
a noise so only its peaks fill; the shader's finer noise rounds their outlines. A puddle is dark water mirroring the sky
with the sun's glint; while it rains, rings spread in it. On about half the days after rain, early in the day and with
the sun out, a rainbow stands in the sky: a faint arc over the upper screen, opposite the sun, with a fainter second bow
outside it, fading towards the ground at both ends; it is at infinity, so it stays put as the view pans. **Lightning**
(its own tick, off by default): in heavy rain on parkland and links courses a near strike now and then (a bright flash
and two after-flickers, the sky end brighter) and fainter, more frequent flicker in the distance, timed by a hash of the
effects' clock. With the *Weather that matters* gameplay extra on (docs/PLAYING.md), the lightning comes only on the
thunderstorm days the golfers shelter from (a share of the heavy-rain days, `sg_core::weather::Place::storm_on`); with
it off it comes on every heavy-rain day as before.

### Ball trail and impacts

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_ball.rs`. After each simulation tick the balls are read (nothing is written back): a ball in the
air adds its place to its trail (the last 8 ticks are kept), and a ball whose height was above 0 at the last tick and is 0
now has come down. The trail is a ribbon through those places up to the ball as drawn, as wide as the ball and fading
with age. An impact is drawn by what the tile is: sand traps, waste and pot bunkers throw a pale dust cloud and darker
grains; water spreads two rings and throws drops (next to the original's own splash sprite); anything else flicks a few
blades of grass. A bounce makes a smaller one. What varies between impacts comes from a hash of the impact.

### Life on the course

Everything here keeps to the original art's look: the birds are the original's own fly-over sprites, and what has no
original art is drawn as a few crisp pixels at the art's pixel size, lit like the sprites, never as smooth shapes.

- **Birds of prey**: now and then one or two of the theme's bird (eagle on parkland, vulture in the desert, pelican in the
  tropics, hawk on links courses) wheel in wide circles over the course for a while, with the original fly-over's sprite
  and wingbeat. They are drawn only: the game's own fly-overs, their timing and their sounds are untouched. Not in the
  dark or the rain. The free graphics have no bird sprites, so they show with the player's SimGolf files.
- **Butterflies**: from May to September, over some of the flower beds, a dark body pixel and two coloured wing pixels
  that open and close as they flit about. Not in the dark or the rain.
- **Falling leaves**: in September and October, with *Seasons*, leaves drop from broadleaf trees one pixel or two at a
  time, tumbling and drifting with the wind, more as the autumn colours deepen.

Test hooks: `SG_FX_BIRDS=1` keeps two birds of prey circling round the middle of the view (the fly-over sprite flies high above its ground point, so `SG_FX_BIRDS_AT=-1,5` moves the circle that many tiles to bring the bird to the screen's middle); `SG_FX_MONTH` picks the month.

### Tournament atmosphere

During an SGA tournament or Play a Championship, spectators gather round the green and along both sides of the fairway
of each hole being played, about twenty a hole, watching the ball while one is in the air there and the green the rest of the time. They are the game's own golfer sprites in the usual
random colours, standing, and every so often a hole's crowd cheers (the golfers' *Happy* clip) for a
moment. They stand only on grass and rough on the club's land, never on greens, tees, sand, water, woods or buildings.
They are drawn only: the golfers and the simulation do not see them. The original has no grandstand or fireworks art, so
there are none, to keep to the original's look.

### Climate

Each of the sixteen properties has its own weather, by where it is on the world map: rain on about 45 days in a hundred in
Ireland, Scotland and Wales, about a third in Nova Scotia, the Northeast and Florida, a few in a hundred in Las Vegas and
Phoenix (a rare desert shower), and tropical showers in Hawaii, Oahu and Jamaica. Each game year is also wetter or drier
than the place's usual (from half as many rainy days to half as many again), so no two years are alike. A property a mod
adds takes its theme's climate.

### Winter

The game's year runs from March to October, so its winter is only a tail at the start, and it is not there every year:
each year rolls whether it ends with a cold snap, more likely in the Rocky Mountains, Nova Scotia and the Northeast,
sometimes in Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Carolina, rarely in Spain, and never on a desert or tropical course or in
California and Florida. In a year with a cold snap, the first days of March have full morning frost and, with *Rain* on,
snow showers instead of rain (small square flakes drifting with the wind, and no puddles); with *Time of day* on, about a
third of those days also start with a light snowfall that melts away by mid-morning, so the course reads clearly while
it is being built. The snow settles first in the hollows and the shade, in drifts with a fine grain at their edges, and
the grass between them turns a dull winter green; it lies white on the tops of the trees' crowns, dusts their lit
leaves and covers the roofs (the original sprites recoloured, as the autumn colours are). It is gone from everything
once the cold days are over. Late October has its frosty mornings (*Seasons*) but no snow. Drawing only:
golfers play as ever. Test hook: `SG_FX_SNOW=S` lays that much snow (0 to 0.67) whatever the hour or the year, with
`SG_FX_MONTH` in the first days of March (e.g. 3.05).

### Heat waves

`crates/simgolf/src/fx_heat.rs` (the port's own). On desert courses only, on about 45 in a hundred summer days (June to
August, easing in through May and out through September; `[economy.weather] heat_percent` in data/economy.toml), never on
a rainy day: the sun warmer and brighter, the colours a little washed out and the sky bleached towards a pale warm white,
strongest through the midday hours with the time of day (a steady look without it), and a warm haze over the far part of
the view. On the hottest of those days the grass is parched towards straw (the terrain shader's autumn grade, on grass
only), green again once the heat breaks. It costs nothing measurable: the light's colours, the haze and an existing
shader grade, no pass of its own, so the frame-rate guard has nothing to step down for it. (A heat shimmer would need a
distortion pass of its own, so there is none.) Which days are hot is the same hash the *Weather that matters* extra
plays. Test hook: `SG_FX_HEAT=K` makes every day that hot (0 to 1), for the drawing and, with the extra on, the game.

### The weather's days

What decides the weather (which days rain, the climates, the snowy years and the dustings, the storms and the heat
waves) is `crates/sg-core/src/weather.rs`, the same hashes as before it moved there, so every day looks as it did. With
the *Weather that matters* gameplay extra on, the weather's day is the game's (three game months, the day of light at
its normal length) whatever the *Day length*, so the rain falls when the golfers play in it; with it off, the weather's
day is the light's, as before.

### Lit windows, dawn sprinklers, frost (0.5)

The port's own, each its own tick, all with the time of day (without it there is no evening or morning):

- **Lit windows** (*Warm light in the buildings' windows at night*, Atmosphere, on): the windows of *Evening lights* above
  on a tick of their own, with the warm pool spilling round each building; *Lamps and fireflies at dusk* keeps the lamps
  and the fireflies. The windows are found in each frame's art, so the original's buildings and the free set's alike glow
  (the free set's pale-blue panes are framed by its light walls as the original's dark ones are). Both lights share the
  evening's strength (`Atmos::night`).
- **Dawn sprinklers** (*Sprinklers on the fairways and greens at dawn*, Atmosphere, on; `crates/simgolf/src/fx_dawn.rs`):
  from phase 0.975 (just before dawn) to 0.09, gone by 0.15, not in the rain, the snow or on a frosty morning. Where they
  stand is a render-side hash of the course: about one tee, green or fairway tile in fifteen, at least four tiles apart, at
  most 24. Each throws a jet that sweeps to and fro across a half circle round its own heading; its 30 drops leave the
  nozzle one after another and fly out along the jet as it pointed when they left, arcing up a third of the throw (1.5
  tiles) and down, a solid two-pixel stream near the nozzle breaking into single drops and falling spray. The drops and
  the riser are squares of the art's pixel size in the sprites' depth order (render.rs draws them with the lamps), tinted
  by the dawn light as the sprites are; a soft dark disc under each, drawn with the evening's pools, is the watered grass.
- **Frost** (*Frost on cold mornings, melting by late morning*, Weather, on): the seasons' frost on a tick of its own
  (*Seasons* keeps the blossom, the autumn colours and the dew), on cold mornings from March to mid April and in October
  (and full in a late-winter cold snap, fx_winter.rs), from dawn to phase 0.2. None where the theme has no winter: the
  desert's frost was taken out with the tropics'. The terrain shader lays it on the grass (fairways, greens and tees
  included) as an even pale sheen with a fine grain of brighter rime when it is full, and as it thins the sheen melts back
  in patches into the hollows and the shade (a threshold on the patch noise plus the occlusion that rises as the frost
  weakens) before it goes.
- **Pixel-perfect scaling** (*Pixel-perfect scaling: whole sizes only*, Display, off; counts in Classic too, like the frame
  rate cap): `ui::view_scale` gives the window pixels per 800 x 600 pixel for the interface and the course alike, and with
  this on it takes the largest whole number that fits (a window smaller than 800 x 600 still shrinks), with the picture's
  corner on a whole pixel; textures made the classic way (the interface art, the sprites, the classic font, not the
  mipmapped terrain) magnify nearest-neighbour; `ui::pixel_border` covers the window round the picture (black, or the
  widescreen frame's dark green with Enhanced on) and Enhanced widescreen stays off while it is on. Enhanced's own
  smoothing (smooth interface art, the pixel-art scaler) is the player's choice and still applies when ticked. Every
  `(w / 800).min(h / 600)` in the renderer and the effects goes through `ui::view_scale`, so with the option off the numbers
  are the same as before.

### Performance

The cost is per pixel and small: the terrain shader adds one light-map fetch and the light per pixel; water about a dozen
noise evaluations; the edge-directed scaler 22 texture fetches per sprite or interface pixel (the costliest effect); the
composite three fetches per pixel plus blur passes at a quarter of the resolution (six small passes with bloom and
tilt-shift). On a mid-range GPU that is well under a millisecond for each at 3840 × 2160. `SG_FX_BENCH=N` (with `--png`)
draws N frames offscreen and prints the mean frame time, to measure on real hardware. The test machine has no GPU (Mesa's software renderer),
where only relative costs mean anything:

| 3840 × 2160, software renderer (llvmpipe, 4 shared cores, best of 3 runs of 6 frames) | ms a frame |
|---|---|
| Classic | 117 |
| effects on, every option off | 123 |
| scaler, sharp bilinear | 278 |
| scaler, edge-directed | 851 |
| water | 308 |
| light + occlusion + shadows | 252 |
| sky | 154 |
| grading + vignette | 161 |
| bloom | 190 |
| tilt-shift | 214 |
| defaults, quality low / medium / high | 233 / 468 / 711 |

On the CPU renderer every texture fetch is expensive, which is why the edge-directed scaler dominates there; a GPU does
these fetches in parallel from cache. The runs varied by up to 2× with other work on the machine.

If a GPU struggles: quality low (no blur passes, sharp scaler), then the scaler sharp or off, then tilt-shift and bloom off.

The Smooth filter (16 texture fetches and some 60 exponentials a magnified pixel, most of them only where there is an
edge) against the others, on the played desert save with the dock open, the scaler alone (every other effect off) and
with the default effects, the best of three alternating runs of 6 frames:

| software renderer, ms a frame | 1920 × 1080 | 3840 × 2160 |
|---|---|---|
| Classic | 31 | 59 |
| effects on, every option off | 37 | 96 |
| scaler, sharp bilinear | 38 | 117 |
| scaler, edge-directed | 134 | 419 |
| scaler, smooth | 131 | 366 |
| default effects with the edge-directed filter | 217 | 701 |
| default effects with the smooth filter (the default) | 206 | 637 |

So Smooth costs no more than the edge-directed filter it replaces as the default (the xBR rules fetch 22 texels a pixel).

The cast shadows, time of day, weather and ball effects were measured the same way, each against the effects without
them (the scaler off, so its cost does not drown theirs), in alternating runs because the shared machine's load moved the
times by up to 2× between runs: a played desert course at 1920 × 1080, 20 frames a run, the best of four runs each.

| 1920 × 1080, software renderer | without | with | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| cloud shadows (one texture fetch a ground pixel) | 122 | 142 | +19 ms |
| distance haze (a blended gradient over the upper screen) | 143 | 154 | +11 ms |
| mist (one texture fetch a ground pixel) | 67 | 92 | +25 ms |
| rain (about 700 streaks) | 98 | 110 | +12 ms |
| time of day (uniforms; the light map again every 3° of sun) | 110 | 104 | within the noise |
| cast shadows, sprites without art shadows | 167 | 159 | within the noise |
| cast shadows from every sprite (with the time of day) | 185 | 187 | +2 ms |
| ball trail and impacts | 103 | 111 | +9 ms (only while balls fly) |
| all of the new options at once | 180 | 222 | +42 ms (+23%) |

As with the other effects the software renderer pays for every texture fetch; on a GPU the two extra fetches a ground
pixel (clouds, mist), the half-size shadow mask (one pass of outline quads and one full-screen multiply) and a few
thousand rain and particle vertices are far below a millisecond. If a GPU struggles, mist and clouds go first.

The reflections, wind, evening lights, seasons and wet ground were measured the same way (a parkland course turned so
trees and a hotel stand behind the water, at dusk in October with wet ground and a breeze, the scaler off), but the
shared machine was loaded far more heavily this time (load 8 to 9 on 4 cores) and single runs varied by up to 3×, so only
the totals mean much: at 1920 × 1080 the medians of four alternating runs were 625 ms a frame without the five options
and 783 ms with all of them (about +25%); each option alone was within the noise. At 3840 × 2160 two runs each gave 868 /
2136 ms without and 1873 / 2644 ms with. What they cost on the GPU: the reflections draw the sprites near water a second
time into a half-size target (a third at low quality) and the water shader one more fetch; the seasons and the wet
ground one detail-map fetch and a few noise evaluations a ground pixel; the wind bends sprites into five strips (more
vertices, no more pixels); the evening lights a cached glow quad per building and a few hundred small quads for lamps
and fireflies. The recoloured trees are made on the CPU when the season moves on by an eighth (a few milliseconds, once).
If a GPU struggles: quality low, then reflections off.

The water options were measured with `SG_FX_BENCH=60` on the demo course's lake at `--zoom 1.8`, 1280 × 800, with
Mesa's software renderer (llvmpipe), the lake about half the screen: 105 to 110 ms a frame before them, 120 to 123 ms with
all of them on (about 12% on a renderer with no GPU; not measured on a real GPU here, where the shader's few extra noise
lookups per water pixel are small), 2 ms of CPU either way (the life and spray are a few hundred vertices).

### Limitations

- The reflections mirror the sprites, not the terrain (a hill behind a lake is not mirrored), and a reflection is the
  sprite flipped, not the far side of the object.
- The windows are found by colour in the art, so a few dark patches that are not windows glow and a few windows (light
  grey panes) stay dark; HD packs are not searched (the windows glow only in the classic art), nor recoloured for the
  seasons.
- The wind bends the bodies, not the art's shadow frames or the cast shadows; a flag's shadow does not turn with it.

- The light map follows the heights and water, not the sand bunkers' dished centres (the mesh's own normals still light them).
- The cast shadows are a sprite's outline laid flat from its ground point: a building's depth is not modelled (the part of
  it behind the ground point casts as if it stood on it), and on a slope the shadow lies in the plane of its ground point.
- Mist and haze veil the ground; the sprites standing in mist are not veiled (they are tinted for light, rain and clouds
  only).
- Under the time of day the water and sprites keep their midday art: the light tints them, it does not relight them.
- With very gentle hills the decoded light (25° up) casts little shadow; the occlusion is what shows the relief.
- Tilt-shift blurs by screen height only (the camera is orthographic: there is no real depth to focus on).

## Photo mode

`crates/simgolf/src/photo.rs`. A way to take pictures of the course, for wallpapers and sharing. It opens only with Enhanced
graphics on (its effects included) and the Display page's *Photo mode* tick, on the course with nothing over it:

- **C** (a key the original's key handler leaves unused; Shift+C stays *Save course for Championship*), or
- the **camera button** under the rating pills at the top right (Enhanced only; it shows *Photo mode (C)* when the pointer is
  on it). A tap works the same on a phone or tablet.

The interface goes away (HUD, dock, panels, ticker, names and thoughts, tooltips, the tool's preview and the aim line) and
the course is shown alone. The game **pauses** on opening, so the golfers hold their swing; Space (or the *Resume* button)
lets it run on while the photo is framed. The mouse pointer hides after 2.5 seconds without input.

| Input | What it does |
|---|---|
| drag, arrows | move the camera (with the smooth camera's glide, whatever the *Smooth camera* tick) |
| wheel, pinch, Z / X, + / - | zoom smoothly from half the original's farthest level to four times its closest |
| PageUp / Home, a two-finger twist | turn the view a quarter |
| click or tap | put the focus there (the focus blur is sharp round it) |
| F | the focus blur on (strength 3) or off; [ and ] weaken and strengthen it (1 to 5) |
| L (Shift+L back) | the look: Natural (the theme's own grade), Warm, Vivid, B&W, Vintage |
| V | the vignette on or off |
| R | the photo's size: the window's, twice the window's, 4K (3840 × 2160) |
| Enter | take the photo |
| Space, P | pause or resume the game |
| H | hide or show the hint and the buttons |
| Esc, C, the Android back button | leave photo mode |

A hint at the top lists the keys, and a row of buttons along the bottom does the same for the mouse and touch (Leave,
Pause / Resume, Look, Blur, Vignette, Size, Take photo); both fade out after a few seconds and come back with any input. None
of them is in a photo.

**Leaving** gives everything back as it was: the camera's place, zoom and turn (an animated turn too), the pause, the
followed golfer. Photo mode closes by itself when the game needs the screen (a report, a question, a great shot's photo).

**The picture.** Photo mode always draws through the effects' post-processing (fx.rs `fx_world_begin` / `fx_world_end`),
whatever the post-processing ticks, with its own composite: the focus blur (the course blurred at a quarter of its size, one
to three more passes for a stronger blur, mixed in by the distance to the focus point, the sharp area flattened into a wide
band as a tilted camera over a miniature sees it), the user's bloom, the look (contrast, vibrance, saturation, lifted
blacks, a tint and, for Vintage, a sepia tone) and the vignette. The zoom goes past the original's levels, so the sprites are
magnified more: the pixel-art scaler (when on) keeps them sharp.

**Taking a photo** draws the course alone once more into an offscreen target of the photo's size (anti-aliased with
Enhanced's multisampling up to 4K), with the scaler told the target's size and the blur spread by the target's size over
the window's, so a larger photo looks like the screen, only sharper. A size the graphics driver cannot draw is scaled down
to its largest texture (at most 8192 pixels a side). The shutter sounds (the SimFoto's), the screen flashes, and a line says
where the photo went. Photos are PNG files named `OpenSGolf <course> <date> <time>.png` (UTC):

- desktop: `Photos` in the save folder (next to `settings.json` and `Saved Games`);
- browser: downloaded (the page hands every PNG the game writes to the browser as a download, as with Shift+F6);
- Android: `Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/Photos` (the app's external files folder, next to `game/`, reachable from
  a computer over USB; the phone's gallery is not told about it).

In the browser the post-processing needs a depth buffer in an offscreen target, which WebGL 2 refuses with miniquad's
unsized depth format; `web/opensgolf.js` gives such a texture the sized format of its type (16 bits), so photo mode's
looks, blur and photos work in the browser too. The rest of the browser build keeps skipping the post-processing as before.

**Classic.** Nothing of photo mode exists with Enhanced off: the C key, the button and every hook (`App::photo`, the zoom's
range, the touch buttons, render.rs's tool preview, fx.rs's composite) ask whether photo mode is open, which it cannot be.
Checked: Classic scenes (800 × 600 to 3840 × 2160, a panel, a report, the menu, Preferences, a new game) render byte for
byte as before; Enhanced scenes differ only by the camera button.

**Test hook:** `--edit "P:LOOK,BLUR,VIGNETTE,ZOOM,HINT,SHOOT"` opens photo mode for stills: LOOK 0 to 4, BLUR 0 (off) to
5, VIGNETTE 0 or 1, ZOOM in percent of the closest level (0 keeps the zoom), HINT 1 shows the hint and buttons, SHOOT 1 to
3 takes a photo at the window's size, twice it or 4K after the first frame (written to `Photos` in the save folder).
`SG_CLICK=x,y` puts the focus there first. For example
`--size 1920x1080 --enhanced --edit "P:1,3,1,0,0,3"` with `SG_CLICK=1500,560` saves a warm 4K photo focused there.

**Note for developers.** miniquad keeps a cache of the texture bound to each unit and does not drop a deleted texture from
it, so a texture made later under the same GL name may not be bound again. The end of a frame (`commit_frame`) clears the
cache; the photo's offscreen drawing makes and deletes targets in the middle of a frame (the post-processing at the photo's
size), so it clears the cache before and after, and so does fx.rs `free_post` when the post-processing's targets are
made again for a new size (without that the next frame's course came out black or banded).

## For developers: adding an option

The other Enhanced options (shaders and effects) add themselves the same way:

1. a field in `enhanced::Settings` (with `#[serde(default)]` old settings files still read) and its default in
   `Settings::DEFAULT`;
2. an `OptionEntry` in `enhanced::OPTIONS` (settings key, a text key in `lang/en.txt` whose text starts with a space, the
   page it is on (`DISPLAY`, `EFFECTS`, `ATMOSPHERE`), its choices' text keys for a setting with more than two values (the
   label then has a `{VALUE}`; empty for a tick), getter, setter, and `Reload::Art` when the option changes how textures
   are made; the `tick!` macro writes the common case);
3. a switch like `pub fn smooth_ui() -> bool { on(|s| s.smooth_ui) }`, asked before the new code runs. It is false whenever
   the master switch is off, which is what keeps Classic byte-identical.

The Preferences screen lists a page's options in `OPTIONS` order under the master switch (bit 0 the master switch, bit 1 +
i the page's option i, at most 31 a page); the box is sized for the longest page and the widest line of all. Interface
code that should sit at a window edge calls `Screen::anchor(Anchor::...)` before drawing; nothing happens in Classic or
with the widescreen option off.

## If Enhanced graphics stop the game

While Enhanced graphics start (when they are switched on, and at each start with them on) the game keeps a marker,
`enhanced_starting`, in the save folder and removes it once it has drawn 60 frames over at least 20 seconds with them (or
when the desktop game is quit normally before then). A run that freezes or stops before then leaves the marker behind,
and the next start comes up safe: Classic, and the two Display settings that count in Classic too (the frame rate cap and
v-sync) at their defaults; it saves that and says so in a box, and the player can change them again in Preferences. In the
browser, adding `?classic` to the page's address does the same on purpose, and `?safe` (or *Reset graphics settings* on
the start page) puts every Enhanced setting back to its default before starting (only *Fix original bugs* is kept; saved
games and every other setting are untouched).

The browser version also watches the game's drawing (web/opensgolf.js). When the browser loses it (a WebGL context lost:
the graphics driver reset or the browser's GPU process restarted; a frame that stopped with an error; or no frame drawn
for five seconds while the tab is shown), the page says so over the frozen picture with a button to reload, writes a line
to the console (`OpenSGolf: the browser stopped drawing the game (...)`) and leaves the marker (Enhanced on or not), so
the reload comes up with the safe settings. Leaving a game that was drawing well takes the marker away. The game's own lines about
Enhanced (switched on, too slow, a shader that does not compile, switched off after a failed start) go to the browser's
console too.

Issue #55: on two desktops (an RTX 5080 and an RTX 2080 Super, 2560-pixel screens, Firefox and Chrome) switching Enhanced
on in the browser froze the picture while the sound played on, and after a reload only the title's exit button seemed to
work. That is what a lost drawing looks like (reproduced with a lost WebGL context and with a frame that throws; the
reporters' GPUs could not be tested here): miniquad asks for the next frame only after drawing one, so the first frame
that fails ends the drawing for good, and the clicks still reach the game unseen (the exit button reloads the page, the
only thing that shows). The 0.4.0 marker went after 60 frames, a quarter of a second on a fast display, so a failure a
moment later found it gone and every restart came up in Enhanced again; and none of the game's lines reached the browser's
console, so the frame rate guard's steps, had there been any, were never seen.

The real cause, found in 0.4.5 from the reporter's console (only the "no frame drawn for 5 seconds" line), from `?classic`
not helping and from a fresh browser profile working until the options were set again: the frame rate cap. The page
decided whether a frame was due once per callback, and the page's own animation-frame loops (the sound pump and the
controller poll), asked for before the game's and so run first in every frame, took each due frame themselves. With any
cap set (30 to 240) the game drew its first frame and never another, in Classic too since the cap counts there, and the
setting stayed saved, so every start froze on the title (reproduced in Chromium with `{"enhanced":{"frame_cap":1}}` alone).
Now the decision is made once per animation frame and holds for every callback in it, the page's own loops are not capped,
and the marker's safe start also clears the cap.

## When the game is too slow for the options in use

With Enhanced on, the game watches its own frame rate. Under 10 frames a second over four seconds (after eight seconds'
grace at start and after each change; a tab the browser stopped drawing does not count) it turns off the costliest
option that is still on, saves that, and says so in the ticker: first the pixel-art scaler (on a laptop's graphics chip
in a browser it alone can cost five times the frame), then multisampling (not in a browser, which never multisamples), then the heaviest effects (cast shadows,
reflections, bloom, grass, crowds, effects quality to low), and last Enhanced itself. Any of them can be switched on again
in Preferences. Issue #55 was this: on some machines switching Enhanced on in the browser made the game hardly move.
