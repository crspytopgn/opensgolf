# Playing the club

## Your own SimGolf files

Double-click OpenSGolf (`opensgolf.exe`, `OpenSGolf.app`, the AppImage); no options are needed. It looks for your copy of
SimGolf in this order and plays on the first folder that holds the game's data (`Interface/TitleBASE.pcx`, `Data/Textures`,
`Flics` and `Themes`, names in any case; a folder above it such as the copied CD with its `Program_Files_(ENGLISH)` is
followed down up to two levels):

1. `--game DIR` (for scripts and tests; it always wins);
2. the folder you chose in the game, saved as `game_dir` in `settings.json` in the save folder, while it still holds the files;
3. a `SimGolf` or `game` folder next to the program (and, on macOS, in `OpenSGolf.app/Contents/Resources` or beside the
   app; beside the AppImage file);
4. `game` in the save folder, then the usual install places: Windows `Program Files (x86)` / `Program Files` with
   `Maxis\SimGolf`, `EA GAMES\SimGolf` or `Electronic Arts\SimGolf`, and `C:\SimGolf`; macOS `~/Games/SimGolf`, `~/SimGolf`,
   `/Applications/SimGolf`; Linux `~/.local/share/opensgolf/game`, `~/SimGolf`, `~/Games/SimGolf` and a Wine install
   (`~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files*/Maxis/SimGolf` or `EA GAMES/SimGolf`);
5. `game` in the folder it was started from.

With none found it plays on the free base set (opensgolf-free), and the first time the title screen says so next to its
**Use my SimGolf files...** button (top left). That button, and the same line at the end of Preferences, asks whether the
files are a .zip, a CD image (.iso, .cdr), or a folder (installed, or the CD itself), then opens the system's own picker for it (Windows and macOS
dialogs, the desktop's XDG portal on Linux, Android's file picker). A .zip is unpacked into `game` in the save folder, by the
browser version's rules: the game folder is the one holding `Flics`, at any depth; `__MACOSX`, `._` files, videos and
Windows programs are left out (crates/simgolf/src/import.rs). On macOS a picked folder is copied there as well (macOS's
privacy rules for Desktop, Documents and Downloads may refuse the folder on a later start). A folder without the game's data
is refused with a message naming what is not there, a folder the system does not let the game read with a message saying
so; a good one is saved and OpenSGolf starts again on the original files (a
real restart, so the original's art, sounds, fonts and tables load exactly as on a normal start; from Preferences during a
game it asks first, as anything not saved is lost). On the original files the button reads **Use the free graphics**, which
saves the free set as the base set (Preferences > Content's choice) and starts again. The browser version has its own
picker on the page and no such button; on Android the files are copied into the app (see Android below).
The native importer also accepts ISO 9660/Joliet images of the SimGolf CD, including a .zip containing one .iso. It reads
game files directly or unpacks the CD's InstallShield 6–16 `data1.hdr`/`data*.cab` archives, including sounds and voices.
No mounting, original installer, or external extraction tool is needed. A Mac's Disk Utility "DVD/CD master" image (.cdr)
is the same thing and is taken wherever an .iso is (in the picker, inside a .zip); an image is known by its contents
(ISO 9660's `CD001` at sector 16), so a misnamed one works too. A compressed Mac .dmg cannot be read: the game says so and
how to make a .cdr instead. **The CD as a folder**: a folder that is the mounted CD (`/Volumes/...` on a Mac, a drive on
Windows), a copy of its files, or a folder above either (names in any case), with no installed game in it, is imported
as its image would be: the `data1.hdr` and `data*.cab` found there are unpacked in place (crates/simgolf/src/iso.rs
`unpack_folder`). A folder with neither the installed game nor the CD's installer is refused with a message saying so.
Other disc formats (BIN/CUE, MDF and UDF) and older InstallShield archives are not supported. The browser page takes
the same: an .iso or .cdr (picked as a .zip is, or inside a .zip), a .zip of the CD's files, or the CD picked as a folder.
It reads the image a part at a time from the picked file (never whole: iPad Safari could not hold it with the game's
files) and unpacks the installer there, with the same reading as iso.rs ported to the page (web/opensgolf.js, "the SimGolf
CD in the browser"; the page unpacks before the game's WebAssembly starts), showing "Unpacking the CD: N of M files"; the
files are the desktop import's byte for byte. A .dmg gets the message on making a .cdr; .7z and RAR archives are refused
with a message (unpack them on a computer first).

**Sounds the copy lacks.** The original's own sound plays wherever the player's copy has the clip; a clip it lacks or
cannot decode (WAV in PCM, float, A-law, mu-law, MS or IMA ADPCM, GSM 6.10, MP2 or MP3, AIFF, or an .ogg, .mp3 or .mp2
file in its place or under the .wav name) is the free set's, clip by clip; when some of the copy's files are in a coding
OpenSGolf cannot play (TrueSpeech, WMA...), a box at start and the browser's summary say "N of your sounds use a format
OpenSGolf can't play yet (e.g. ...)". Test hook: `SG_SOUND_LOAD_ALL=1` decodes every clip at start, logs
"sound: decoded all N clips: N from your files, N the free set's" and writes the sound report (sound.txt) at once. When the copy has no sounds at all (empty `Sounds` and `SimsFX` folders: some downloaded
copies leave them out), only the Sims' voices in `SimsFX`, or lacks more than a quarter of the game's sounds, a box says so once
when the game starts and the ticker on every start (sg_core::mixer `shortfall`; the console or log has a `sound:` line
with the counts). The browser page also sums up what it found after loading the files, in large type on the start page
(and again there on the next visit, as "Last time: ...") and over the game once (20 seconds, or until tapped when
something is missing): "OpenSGolf 0.4.7. Sounds: found N, used N, skipped N (why: the compression's name, damaged, too
big). Art ✓, music: N, Sims' voices: N." The console's `files:` line adds the compression methods the zip used.
Deflate64 (Windows' own zipper, for big files such as the sounds), BZip2, LZMA and PPMd (7-Zip's, Keka's and The
Unarchiver's stronger settings), which iPad's Files app cannot unpack (it shows such folders empty), are read by the
browser (web/files.js), desktop and Android (sg_core::inflate64, sg_core::unpack) alike (issue #10); the browser also
unpacks plain deflate itself when its own DecompressionStream is missing or fails, and checks every file's checksum.
Names in UTF-8 or the old DOS code page, backslashes and Zip64 are read. Sound folders a zip has beside the game folder
rather than in it (or in a second copy of it, or a folder such as "SimGolf Sounds") fill in the sounds the game folder
lacks, and folders differing only in case ("Sounds" and "SOUNDS") are one. Every file of the page carries the version in
its address (web/build.sh), so a browser never runs an older copy of a part of it; the start page shows the version at
its bottom.

Test hook: `SG_PICK_FOLDER=DIR` takes DIR (a folder, the CD as a folder, a .zip, .iso or .cdr) as picked, right after
start up (`SG_PICK_FOLDER=free` chooses the free graphics; with `--png` the still waits for the import and the restart); on Android the intent extra `sg_pick` does the same
(`adb shell am start -n org.opensgolf.game/.MainActivity --es sg_pick PATH`).

A Windows release build is a windowed program (no console window); started from a console with options it writes its
messages to that console. Screenshots (Shift+F6) go to the save folder as `opensgolf-shot.png`.

## The title menu

Start OpenSGolf (from a source build: `opensgolf --game "../game/Program_Files_(ENGLISH)"`). It opens on the title menu, drawn from the disc's own Interface art with the game's font: Start New Game (Standard) or Sandbox Mode opens the property chooser, and picking a property starts a course on that property's theme. A property is paid for out of the §100,000 starting funds (sandbox: unlimited). Esc goes back, and from the course returns to the menu. Continue Saved Game opens Load Previous Game (the disc's Title_LoadGame art): the saved games in a list of 16 rows with the scroll arrows, a click on a row shows its holes, par, yards, cash, ratings, theme pack, designer and course record on the left, the tick loads it, the folder deletes it after a yes/no box, the arrow goes back; saves whose names start with '&' are listed as autosaves. Select A Theme opens Select a Theme Pack (the folders under Themes with what each holds); a click on a row picks it, the tick keeps it, the arrow or a key goes back to Standard. A click on the logo shows the credits (credits.txt from the game folder over creditsbckgrd.pcx; a click or key ends them).

**Check for updates** (the port's own button, top right of the title menu, on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android) asks
GitHub for OpenSGolf's newest release and says whether you have it. When a newer version is out, the box offers:

- **Update now**: the game downloads the new version's package for your system, checks it, installs it in place of the
  one you are running and starts it (a box shows how far the download is). On Windows and with the Linux `.tar.gz` the
  new files replace the old ones in the game's folder (the old ones are kept as `NAME.old` until the new version has
  started, then deleted); with the Linux AppImage the AppImage file is replaced; on a Mac the whole `OpenSGolf.app` is
  replaced (the old one is kept as `OpenSGolf.app.old` until the new one starts). On Android the new APK goes to
  Android's installer, which asks you to confirm (and, the first time, to allow OpenSGolf to install apps); the game
  closes while it installs. **Integrity**: every release carries `SHA256SUMS` and its ed25519 signature
  `SHA256SUMS.sig`; the game checks the signature against OpenSGolf's key built into it, then the package's SHA-256
  against the signed list, before it touches a single file. A release without a signature, a signature that is not
  OpenSGolf's or a download that does not match is refused, and so is every release while the build carries no key yet:
  the box then says why and offers the download page. Anything else that goes wrong (no internet, a folder the game may
  not write to such as `/Applications` for a standard user, a copy not installed from a release package) leaves your
  version as it was and offers the download page too.
- **Open the download page**: the release page (https://github.com/crspytopgn/opensgolf/releases/latest) in the system's
  browser, to download and install it as the first time.
- **Not now**.

Privacy: only GitHub is contacted, and only when you click the button (or with the *Check for updates when the game
starts* extra ticked, once at start): one request to `api.github.com` for the newest release, and with Update now the
downloads of `SHA256SUMS`, its signature and the package from GitHub's release files. GitHub sees your IP address and
`OpenSGolf/<version>` as the program asking, as for any web page; nothing about you or your games is sent. The browser
version is always the newest, so it has no such button, nor has a build without the `net` feature. Test hooks:
`SG_UPDATE_URL=file:///path/latest.json` checks at start against a saved answer (`{"tag_name":"v0.4.0"}`, with an
`assets` list of `name` and `browser_download_url` for Update now; `file://` and local `http://` addresses work) instead
of GitHub; `SG_UPDATE_KEY=HEX` checks signatures against that public key instead of the built-in one; `SG_UPDATE_NOW=1`
chooses Update now as soon as a newer version is found.

For scripted runs (any of `--png`, `--course`, `--edit`, `--golfer`, `--sandbox`, `--follow`) the game skips the menu and opens on the demo course; `--screen menu|property|play` forces a screen. Add `--theme Desert` for another look there. `--property NAME` (or 0..15) starts a new game on that property straight away, and `--clock MS` fixes the value the exe's random generator is seeded from, so the same land comes back every run.

- **Holes** are built one at a time with the exe's rules (docs/GAMELOGIC.md): paint one Tee tile (G twice, or the Paint tool) and a Putting Green, then press H or click the cup green to open the hole. Its par comes from its planned length. Painting over a hole's tee or cup closes that hole until it is rebuilt. Courses made outside the tool (the demo course, saved terrain) have their tee and green pairs turned into holes when they load. Shift+H hides the story lines.
- **Golfers** follow the exe's rules (docs/GAMELOGIC.md): invited members come in pairs, walk and play every hole, use the amenities, pay a green fee equal to their mood at the end of each hole, and quit for good when their mood falls below zero. Happy members upgrade their membership and bring friends.
- **Fun** sums each hole's mood changes the way the exe does. Happy golfers pay more, unhappy ones less.
- **Money:** you start with §100,000 (confirmed from the publisher's golf.exe and the property screen). The green fee defaults to 1000 per hole, from the scale seen in course reports. Upkeep and wages are charged every game day (120 seconds). When cash stays below zero the board sends warnings and then ends the game, in four steps (the days are placeholders). Sandbox mode never charges.
- **The land** of a new game is built the way the exe builds it: each game deals the properties into sixteen offer slots (which set the acreage and price shown on the chooser), and the land generator lays out trees, creek, coast, ponds and rocks, wildlife spots, the clubhouse, the property's own feature and the difficulty's obstacles, and leaves the land beyond the purchased acreage out of bounds (not drawn) or, on an island, under water. Landmarks, obstacles and free buildings are drawn with the exe's art for the theme. Your own pro starts at the clubhouse and, until the first hole opens, follows the pointer as the exe's pro does, and after that works like the staff around his post (he can be moved like them, except while he plays a round); hired staff (People button) work around their post the way the exe's staff do: the Soda Vendor sells drinks to thirsty golfers, the Club Pro chats to golfers, the Ranger hurries them, the Groundskeeper pulls weeds. Click an employee on the course, then click where they should work, to move their post (the scripted hook `--edit "h:KIND,X,Y[,F]"` hires one with a post; F bit 1 the experienced version, bit 2 arms Move). Weeds grow and golfers complain about grown ones (-2 mood). The console prints events (strokes, fees, board messages).

- **Course Report:** press F1 on the course. It uses the disc's report art and lists every hole: yards, par, average strokes, time, fun, the +Len/+Acc/+Img scores (measured by simulating golfers with and without each skill, as the original's Shot Analysis suggests), type, average fee, revenue and profit. Yards, minutes and the profit split are placeholder scales. Esc, F1 or a click closes it. `--screen report` opens it directly.

Saving: Shift+S (or System Functions, Save the current game) opens the Save dialog ("SAVE GAME, edit name then press Enter"): Enter saves the whole game (land, golfers, holes, staff, money, calendar, theme pack and the random generator, so it continues exactly) to `Saved Games/<name>.sgs` in the save folder and shows "Game Saved"; Esc cancels. Shift+L (or Load a previous game) opens Load Previous Game over the game, whose arrow goes back to it. Test hooks: `--screen load|save|themes|credits|champ|pickapro` opens these screens (with `--property` the load and save screens open over a game), `SG_HOVER=n` lights button n (0 OK, 1 back, 2 up, 3 down, 4 delete) with its tooltip, `SG_SELECT=r` selects row r and `SG_CONFIRM=1` opens the delete box. Test hooks: `--save-game F` saves after the `--time` simulation, `--load-game F` starts from a saved game. `--cash N` sets the starting cash, `--time S` simulates S seconds before taking `--png`, `--edit "t:x,y,type;o"` paints one tile through the hole tool (type 0 tee, 1 green) and opens the hole being built, `--edit "e:x,y,n,r"` raises (or with a negative n lowers) every vertex of the square of side 2r + 1 round vertex x,y by n steps (stills of steps and retaining walls).

## Saved games: where they are, backups and imports

Every game you save is one file, `<name>.sgs`, in `Saved Games` in the save folder (autosaves and the quick save too, as
`&Latest.sgs`, `&Quick.sgs` and so on). Courses and pros saved for championship play are in `Championship` beside it
(`.sgch` and `.pro`), and the save folder also holds `settings.json` (preferences, keys, extras) and `top10.sve` (the Top 10
Designers). A save file is complete on its own: copy it to another computer, or between the desktop and the browser
versions, and it loads there.

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\OpenSGolf\Saved Games` (type `%APPDATA%\OpenSGolf` in Explorer's address bar).
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/OpenSGolf/Saved Games` (Finder: Go, Go to Folder...).
- **Linux and the Steam Deck**: `~/.local/share/opensgolf/Saved Games`.
- `OPENSGOLF_SAVE_DIR` puts the whole save folder elsewhere (a USB stick, a synced folder). A folder from before the
  project was called OpenSGolf (`SimGolf` / `simgolf` in the same place) keeps being used.
- **Android**: the app's own internal storage, which other apps cannot reach.

On the desktop, **back up** by copying the save folder (or just `Saved Games`); to **bring a save in**, copy the `.sgs` into
`Saved Games` (while the game runs too: Load Previous Game reads the folder each time it opens). Dropping a `.sgs` on the
game's window does the same when the Course sharing extra is on.

**In the browser** there is no folder: the page keeps the files in this browser's local storage for the site (the same
names, under keys starting `simgolf-file:`). They stay until the site's data is cleared, but a private window, another
browser or another device does not have them, so back them up. On the start page, **Your saved games: back up and restore**:

- **Back up my saves** downloads `opensgolf-saves-<date>.zip`: every saved game, championship course and pro, the settings,
  the Top 10 table and the accomplishment snapshots the page keeps (not your game files, the HD pack or content packs,
  which have their own buttons). The files are stored in the zip as they are, under the same names as in a desktop save
  folder, so the zip can also be unpacked into a desktop save folder.
- **Restore saves...** takes such a backup (its files replace those of the same name), a zip of a desktop save folder
  (whatever folder it was zipped from; the game copy, HD pack, photos and reports in it are left out, its content packs
  go with the page's packs), or single files: saved games (`.sgs`, into Saved Games), championship courses (`.sgch`) and
  pros (`.pro`), `settings.json`, and the original's `top10.sve`. A single file never replaces a save of the same name: it
  is added as "Name (2)". The games are then in Load Previous Game.

**In the game**, with the Course sharing extra on (System Functions > Preferences > OpenSGolf extras; not in the original),
Load Previous Game has two buttons of the port's own under the list: **Import a save file...** (the system's file
picker, or the browser's) adds a saved game, a shared course (`.sgch`, to the championship courses), a text file with a
course code, or the original's `top10.sve`, as dropping it on the window does; **Export this save...** writes a copy of
the selected save where you choose (the browser downloads it). Test hooks: `SG_PICK_SAVE=FILE` imports FILE without the
picker, `SG_EXPORT_SAVE=FILE` exports to FILE.

**The original SimGolf's files.** Its saved games (`Saved Games\<name>.sve` in its folder) cannot be read: what the exe
writes is known only as a list of blocks (a 100-byte header text, then the cash, the clock, the difficulty and several
counters, the object table, the map arrays, the golfer table, the property list and the history ring;
docs/DECODE_WORLD2.md 6.2), not the layout of each block, so a conversion would be guesswork. Picking or dropping one says
so. Its Top 10 Designers (`top10.sve`) has the same layout as the port's: importing it in the game adds its designers to
your table (its made-up default designers are left out, and the best ten of both stay); the start page's Restore puts it in
place of the browser's table, after asking.

## Course size

OpenSGolf can start a game on a map larger than the original's. The choice is on Select Difficulty (Start New Game and
Sandbox Mode), in the box at the bottom left: a click steps through the sizes. Original is the default and plays exactly as
SimGolf does; scenarios and championships always use their own course's size.

| Size | Map | Yards a side | A sandbox (all the map) | Tracts for sale |
|------|-----|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Original | 50 x 50 tiles | 1,250 | 250 acres | 9 of 16 x 16 tiles |
| Large | 74 x 74 | 1,850 | 548 acres | 9 of 24 x 24 |
| Huge | 98 x 98 | 2,450 | 960 acres | 9 of 32 x 32 |
| Giant | 128 x 128 | 3,200 | 1,638 acres | 9 of 42 x 42 |

What changes with the size (n is the map's edge in tiles, 50 on the original's map):

- **The view** zooms further out, so the whole map fits on the screen as the original's does at its farthest zoom: one
  more step (half the original's farthest) on Large and Huge, two (a quarter) on Giant.
- **The land** is made by the same generator with its counts and places scaled: the woods are laid in n^2/2500 passes, there
  is one creek per 50 tiles of edge, the sea's width (5, between 2 and 12 tiles on the original) and the ponds' grid scale
  with n, the wildlife spots, property landmarks and difficulty obstacles grow with the area, and the clubhouse stands in the
  middle of the map. Hills use a mix of two readings of the original's height noise so they do not repeat across the map.
- **The deal:** a property comes with its slot's acres times n^2/2500 (the same share of the map), and its price, the
  starting funds and the sandbox funds are multiplied by n/50. So on Huge (n = 98) the cheapest slot costs §98,000 out of
  §196,000 starting funds and brings about 3.8 times the acres.
- **Buying land:** the Tracts for Sale screen still shows nine tracts on its diamond, each (n - 2)/3 tiles square. A tract's
  price is rolled tile by tile as in the original (and still doubles with every purchase), so land costs the same per acre on
  every size; a bigger tract costs more in proportion to its acres.
- **Golfers and staff** walk across the whole map: the path search's cost limits scale with n. Weeds sprout n^2/2500 times as
  often (the same pace per acre), and the club may employ 20 x n^2/2500 people (at most 64). The routing map and the tract
  screen draw the whole map in the original's diamond, with tiles 50/n as large.
- **One original bug is fixed on the larger sizes only:** the exe's distance function comes out 8 times too long when both
  legs are over 16 tiles; on a larger map the distance is the true one. The original's map keeps the original behaviour.
- **Saves** record the size: a game on a larger map is saved as version 2 with its size and loads at that size; version 1
  saves (every save made before course sizes, and every Original game, byte for byte as before) load as before. OpenSGolf
  0.1 does not know the size field, so open larger-size saves with 0.2 or later; this version refuses a save from a newer
  version or one whose map does not match its size instead of loading it wrong.

Scripted runs take `--course-size N` (an edge from 50 to 200 tiles) with `--property`. With `SG_TICK_BENCH=1` a scripted run
prints the mean and slowest simulation step and the time of each terrain rebuild.

Limits: the object table holds 255 buildings, landmarks and lots (as the original's byte-sized index allows; the port refuses
the 256th), the terrain is rebuilt whole after every edit (about 80 ms on Giant against 30 ms on Original, desktop CPU), and the
Enhanced light and detail maps use fewer texels per tile on the larger sizes (at most about 400 texels a side).

## Course editor

The port's own (crates/simgolf/src/editor.rs; not in the original): a separate mode for making scenarios to play and
share. Nothing of it runs in a normal game.

**Starting.** *Course editor...* (the button at the bottom right of the title menu, left of the exit button) opens Select
Difficulty, with the course size (Original, Large, Huge, Giant), and then the property chooser, every property
available: the property sets the theme (Parkland, Desert, Tropical, Links) and the land is the one a new game on it gets.
The difficulty you pick is the scenario's (change it later in the box). It is a title button rather than a Sandbox Mode
option so that Sandbox Mode stays exactly the original's.

**Building.** Every tool of the game works as in a game: the terrain brushes (with the rectangle and fill, Shift+drag and
Alt+click), raise and lower with the Elevation panel's brushes, the measuring tape ('), trees, water, paths, holes (tee,
green, H to open), buildings, garden items and landmarks (all of them, whatever the number of holes). Nothing costs
money and no time passes: the clock does not run, so no golfers come, nobody is hired by the game and the calendar stays
at March 2001. The cash shown is the scenario's starting cash. Ctrl+Z undoes as in a game (also a heightmap import and a
change of the land owned). Esc opens System Functions (*Quit to the title screen* leaves the editor; Save opens the editor
box).

**The editor box.** The bar at the top of the course, *Course editor: scenario settings*, or **Shift+E** (another key
on *Change keys*) opens it, in the style of the game's other boxes:

- **Name, Author, Description, Welcome text, When won, When lost**: click a field and type (Tab or Enter goes on to the
  next field, Esc stops typing). The welcome text is shown when the scenario starts, the others when it is won or lost
  (the game's own words when they are empty).
- **Starting cash** (- and +, in steps of §10,000), **Difficulty** (Easy to Impossible, or *Player chooses*: Select
  Difficulty is then shown when the scenario starts), **Sandbox game**.
- **Land at the start**: the nine tracts as the TRACTS FOR SALE screen numbers them (1 at the top left, 2 under it).
  Click one to change it: *owned* land is the club's at the start, land *for sale* is out of bounds until the club buys it
  (its tiles keep their types, trees and heights for the purchase; buildings, paths, tees and greens stay owned).
- **Heightmap**: *Import heightmap...* takes a grey PNG picture of any size (8 or 16 bits; a colour picture counts by its
  brightness) and lays it over the whole map: it is resampled to the map's corner grid with bilinear filtering (stretched to
  the map's square), black becomes sea level and white the top of *Heights* (Gentle 4, Rolling 7 or Hilly 10 steps, the
  Elevation tools' highest). **Water** *up to level N* turns every tile whose four corners all lie at or under step N - 1
  into water (shallow, middle or deep by how far under it lies), at sea level as the original keeps water; the land's old
  water goes. **Smoothing** runs one smoothing pass first. Buildings, paths, tees and greens keep their tiles and are
  levelled again; land for sale takes the heights (and its water waits for the purchase). Changing Heights, Water or
  Smoothing lays the last picture again. Three samples are built in (*Valley*, *Ridge*, *Island*: the pictures are
  `tools/heightmaps/*.png`, made by `tools/heightmaps/make_heightmaps.py`). The desktop opens the system's file picker,
  the browser its own; on Android there is no picker, only the samples.
- **Goals** (at most five): *Add a goal*, then click its kind to change it (Holes, Cash, Fun rating, Skill rating,
  Members, Rank), - and + for its value and its deadline (*any time*, or by the end of a year), x removes it. Every goal
  must be reached to win; a goal missed at its deadline loses the scenario. No goals: the scenario is a free game on your
  course.
- **Save scenario** writes the scenario pack into the save folder's `packs` (`<id>/pack.toml`, `scenario.toml` and
  `course.sgs`, the course as it is, with the holes built in the editor), the id made from the name; later saves write
  over it. It is then on *Start New Game* (docs/MODDING.md 5) and starts with `--scenario ID`. **Load scenario...** lists
  the installed scenario packs: one is loaded into the editor (its course, or the land of its property when it has none)
  to go on with it; a pack in the save folder's `packs` is saved back in place, any other (a downloaded .zip, an example)
  as a copy. **Back to the course** (or Esc), **Leave the editor** (click twice; what is not saved is lost).

To share a scenario, zip its folder (or send the folder) and add it to someone's packs folder, or submit it to the
community index (docs/MODDING.md 5 and 7).

Test hooks: `--editor --property P` (with `--course-size N`) starts the editor on property P (`--editor` alone opens
Select Difficulty from the title button); `--edit-scenario ID` loads a scenario pack into it; `--editor-set
"name=..;author=..;description=..;intro=..;win=..;lose=..;cash=N;difficulty=0-3|any;sandbox=0|1;relief=0-2;water=N;

rank); `--heightmap FILE` imports a picture with them; `--edit` specs then paint free of charge; `--save-scenario ID`
saves the scenario as the pack ID (printing the cash and the game tick); `--screen editor` or
`--screen editor-load` opens the box or its Load page; `SG_PICK_PNG=FILE` answers *Import heightmap...*'s picker.
`tools/freeset_playtest.sh` makes a scenario this way, loads it back into the editor, checks the files did not change
and plays it.

## Buildings and garden items

On the Add Buildings panel (or b for benches, Shift+B for a home site; Tab turns the next building) choose: benches, flower beds, ball washers, willow trees and scenic bridges at any time, the amenities as holes unlock them. Prices, clearing charges, upgrades and the path-to-clubhouse rule follow the exe. Benches need rough ground with a free neighbour; bridges go on water near a shore. Shift-click undoes: a path, bench, flower bed, willow or bridge comes off with what it cost back, a building is demolished with no refund. Golfers use what you build: snack bars and the practice buildings earn money on every visit, tired golfers sit on benches, flower beds and landmarks cheer them up. The headless test option is `--edit "b:x,y,kind"`.

## Original game or OpenSGolf extras

Select Difficulty has a **Game** box next to Course size. One click switches between:

- **The original**: every OpenSGolf extra off and Classic graphics; the game exactly as it was (fixes for the original's
  own bugs stay on). A new player starts here.
- **OpenSGolf extras**: the interface extras (People screen, message history, name tags, report tabs, path help, autosave,
  save pictures, course sharing, landing map, comments by hole, history graphs; not the two pauses, the update check or
  zooming towards the pointer, which you tick yourself) and the
  gameplay extras that do not change the game's balance (turning buildings, animals, more staff, path styles and lamps
  with the original's paths until you pick another style).

If you ticked your own choice in Preferences, the box says "your own mix"; a click goes back to the original. The choice
is saved and is what new games start with.

## OpenSGolf extras (optional, not in the original)

Preferences (System Functions, Preferences) has an **OpenSGolf extras...** line. It opens a box of optional changes,
all off unless you tick them, sorted by what they change on five pages (tabs along its top; a click on a tab, Left and
Right or Tab turn them). A banner under the tabs says what the page's ticks do:

- **Gameplay**: "Changes how the game plays." (below)
- **Sandbox**: "Bends the rules for relaxed play." (the calendar's speed and the sandbox switches, below)
- **Looks**: "Changes how it looks. Play is unchanged." (path styles and lamps, below)
- **Info**: "Shows more about your club. Play is unchanged." (the interface extras that show something: People, message
  history, name tags, report tabs, path help, landing map, comments by hole, history graphs, live scorecards, the year in
  numbers, home-site details; see *OpenSGolf extras* further down)
- **Helpers**: "Saves you effort. Play is unchanged." (autosave, save pictures, course sharing, the two pauses, the update
  check, zoom towards the pointer, drag to place, the clickable ticker; also further down)

Each line on the Gameplay and Sandbox pages carries a coloured tag at its right end saying how much it changes the game:
green **Light touch** (Tab turns buildings, buyable animals, left-handed golfers), amber **Noticeable** (higher staff
limits, set par, cut content, weather that matters, more visitors, slower seasons) or red **Big change** (hardcore economy
and the three sandbox switches). The foot of the box describes the line under the pointer in a sentence (on a touch screen
the line last tapped); with none, it says how to read the box. Preferences > Search lists every option with its page and
tag ("Gameplay · Noticeable: Weather that matters..."), and typing a tag's words (*big change*) finds the options so
tagged. With every extra off the game plays exactly as the original. What you tick on the Gameplay, Sandbox and Looks
pages applies to the game you are playing, is saved with that game (a save made with everything off is unchanged), and is
what new games start with (kept in settings.json under `extras`). Which page a line is on changes nothing of the ticks,
saves or settings.

On the **Gameplay** page:

- **Tab turns placed buildings and the clubhouse.** *(Light touch)* With no building tool in hand, Tab turns the building under the
  pointer a quarter: the clubhouse, putting greens, the other amenities and landmarks (the driving range and home sites
  keep their way; the range is drawn tile by tile). Only the picture turns: footprints are square, so paths, golfer
  routes, putting, the clubhouse door and the ratings do not change. With a garden item or the landmark tool in hand, Tab
  steps through its designs (benches, flower beds, scenic trees, bridges, landmarks) as the strip of pictures over the
  panel shows them. The original already turns a putting green or building you are about to place with Tab, and picks a
  random design when you pick a flower bed, scenic tree or bridge (and the first bench); you then choose from the strip.
- **Cut content: unused landmarks.** *(Noticeable)* Fourteen pieces of art that are in the game files but that the original never loads
  (docs/CUT_CONTENT.md) can be placed as landmarks: press the Landmark button on the Amenities panel, and press it again
  to switch between your own landmarks, the cut ones and (with the next extra) the animals. Each costs $6,000 (the port's
  price), golfers enjoy the sight as they enjoy a landmark's (and the course planner treats them as features), but they
  have none of the four landmark powers. They stay for good, as landmarks do.
- **Hardcore economy.** *(Big change)* Tighter money and choosier golfers: by default wages 150%, hole maintenance 200%, land (the
  property and tracts) 150%, debt interest 5% a month, at most $600 per golfer per hole in fees, every bad moment costs a
  golfer one more mood step, and at most 12 employees. The numbers are data/economy.toml's `hardcore_*` fields (docs/MODDING.md).
- **Higher staff limits.** *(Noticeable)* The club may have 40 employees instead of the original's 20 (data/economy.toml's
  `staff_limit_high`, at most 63: the original keeps its walkers in 64 records).
- **Buyable animals.** *(Light touch)* The landmark strip gets a page of the theme's animals (elk and cranes in Parkland, snakes, gila
  monsters and road runners in the Desert, flamingos, crocodiles, snakes and ducks in the Tropics, elk, sheep and ducks on
  the Links). A click on open ground of your course buys a pair (leader and young, $2,000) that drops in as wild animals do
  and then keeps within about three tiles of where it was set down; bought animals never wander off for good. Golfers who
  glance at a tile next to one enjoy the sight (the scenic thought, +1 mood, as a landmark's sight gives), and scaring one
  is the same as scaring a wild one. Up to 32 pairs. The Preferences' "Ambient animals" tick hides and stops them, as it
  does the wild ones.
- **Set par.** *(Noticeable)* The game gives each hole its par from its length when it opens, and sometimes judges a hole too hard or
  too easy for it. With this on, Hole Stats (click a hole on the Course Report) shows **-** and **+** buttons beside the
  par (or press minus and plus there); after a confirmation the hole's par is one less or one more, from 2 to 6. A par you
  set is shown in blue and counts everywhere par does: golfers' scores and their moods over them, birdies and eagles, the
  hole's hard and easy marks and its name, the reports and the best rounds. It is saved with the game and moves with the
  hole on the Routing screen. Rebuilding the hole (painting over its tee or cup green and opening it again) gives it the
  game's par anew, a tournament's checklist sets its own pars, and switching the extra off puts every hole back to the
  game's par. Pars cannot be changed during a tournament.
- **Left-handed golfers.** *(Light touch)* About one golfer in ten who arrives from now on is left-handed (decided by the game's own
  random draws when the golfer is made, and kept with the saved game). A left-hander is drawn as the mirror image of a
  right-hander while addressing the ball, swinging and following through, still facing the shot's target; walking,
  waiting and everything else look as before. His shots bend the other way: his draw curves from left to right and his
  fade from right to left, and his random hooks and slices are mirrored too, so the course's doglegs suit left- and
  right-handers differently (the golfers' own shot planning knows it). Your pro gets a **Left-handed** tick under his
  skills on Customise Golfer (the Player panel's Customize); with it his practice rounds and matches are played
  left-handed, the aim line bending the left-hander's way for a draw or fade (the shot keys keep their names: D is still
  his draw). Switching the extra off puts everyone back to right-handed; switching it on again brings the left-handers
  back.
- **Weather that matters (rain, snow, heat, storms).** *(Noticeable)* The weather Enhanced graphics draws is played too (it changes the
  balance a little, so it is not part of the *OpenSGolf extras* preset). Which days rain follows the property's climate
  (often in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, rarely in the desert), the same days whenever the game is loaded, and a day lasts
  three game months (Enhanced graphics' day of light at its normal length; with the extra on its rain, snow and heat
  keep to these days whatever the *Day length*). Each morning the ticker says what the day brings ("Rain today", "Snow
  today!", "Heat wave today", "Thunderstorms are on the way today") and a small sign after the date on the badge shows
  it all day (a cloud with rain, snow or a bolt, or a sun), so the weather is there without Enhanced graphics too. All
  of it is gentle, a flavour rather than a punishment: over a year it costs a club about 3% of its takings.
  - *Rain*: wet ground holds a rolling ball (it rolls about 15% less on tees, fairways and greens; the golfers putt a
    little harder for the slow greens), about one golfer in ten stays away, and about three in ten of those who tee off
    start a point less happy (no umbrella). The ground dries through the next day, as the Enhanced wet ground does, and
    its soft, lush turf takes the bounce out of a landing ball, so approach shots hold better.
  - *Snow* (the late-winter cold snap of early March, where the place gets snow, and a morning's dusting): balls stop
    almost dead, a quarter of the golfers stay away, half of those who come start a point less happy, and the odd golfer
    who loves the snow starts a point happier.
  - *Heat waves* (desert courses, some summer days): baked ground lets the ball run on (about 10% further) and the greens
    are quicker, golfers get thirsty and hungry sooner (more trips to the snack bars: more sold), a few start a point
    less happy, and a little fewer come in the midday heat.
  - *Thunderstorms* (some heavy-rain days, not in the desert): the storm breaks some time in the day ("Storm! Play is
    suspended..."): nobody tees off, the golfers out on the course wait where they stand (a ball already rolling comes
    to rest), and everyone at the club buys a drink or a bite while sheltering ($100 each). After about twenty seconds
    at normal speed the storm passes and play resumes. With Enhanced graphics' lightning on, the lightning comes on
    these days.
  The numbers are data: `[economy.weather]` in data/economy.toml (docs/MODDING.md; every field may be left out):
  `rain_drag` 12, `snow_drag` 30, `heat_drag` -6 (a rolling ball's extra drag per mille of its speed each game tick),
  `lush_bounce_percent` 70, `rain_turnout_percent` 90, `snow_turnout_percent` 75, `heat_turnout_percent` 85 (at
  midday), `rain_mood_percent` 30, `snow_mood_percent` 50, `snow_lover_percent` 15, `heat_mood_percent` 25,
  `heat_thirst_percent` 75, `heat_percent` 45 (heat-wave days in a hundred desert summer days), `storm_percent` 40
  (thunderstorm days in a hundred heavy-rain days), `storm_ticks` 240 and `storm_spend` 100. A weather mood dip is for
  that round only, and *Freeze golfer happiness* keeps it away too.
- **More visitors: touring pros and celebrities.** *(Noticeable)* New kinds of visitor, the port's own (every name and line is
  invented), turn up with a new pair in the second golfer's place, as the original's VIPs do (never in the same pair as a
  VIP, never during a tournament, one of each kind on the course at a time). **Touring pros** come now and then once nine
  holes are open and the club rating the VIPs go by (fun on Easy and Normal, skill on Hard and Impossible) is 400 or more,
  at most once in two months: strong players with skills of their own (their card shows them, as a famous pro's), who
  play quickly (the game's own hurried pace: a step faster, no dawdling over a shot, not giving way), pay twice the green fee
  an ordinary golfer in their mood would, and at the end of the round rate your course in a few words in the ticker
  ("Touring pro Rena Vasquell rates your course: 'A fair test of golf.'"). **Celebrities** (a film star, a pop star, a TV
  chef, an ex-footballer, a soap star, a racing driver, a novelist, a TV astronomer) come rarely, from six holes and a
  rating of 250, at most once in four months: the ticker announces them, word gets around and six more golfers come to
  the clubhouse soon after, they pay half as much again as an ordinary golfer, and they say what they thought of the
  course when they leave. Visitors look like other golfers (the game's own bodies, heads and colours), show on the People
  screen as *Touring Pro* or *Celebrity* and on their golfer card with their profession, and keep a record on the Best
  Scores like anyone. They do not become members. How often they come, what they wait for and pay, and who they are, is
  in `data/visitors.toml`, which content packs can change and add to (docs/MODDING.md, section 3). Not part of the
  one-click *OpenSGolf extras* choice, as their fees and crowds change the club's takings.

On the **Sandbox** page:

- **Slower seasons: the calendar at 1x / 1/2x / 1/4x.** *(Noticeable)* A click steps the speed (1x is the original). The month and year
  move on at half or a quarter of the original's pace while everything that happens by the game's own clock keeps its
  pace: golfers arrive, play and pay as before, staff work, weeds grow, and wages and hole maintenance are charged as
  often as ever (the original charges them every 1024/(difficulty+2) game ticks, not by the month). So a year holds two or
  four times as much golf, and two or four times as much income and as many wage and upkeep bills. What goes by the
  calendar waits for it: the month's start (2% interest on debt, the monthly reminders about buildings off the paths, the
  month's entry in the history the year-end report and the Histograph draw, the holes' statistics easing by an eighth, the
  scripts' month hook and the goals' checks), the year end (the board's look at the cash, the year-end report, the Top 10,
  the Financial Report's year, the goals' deadlines), the SGA's mid-year tournament offer (once a year, so at 1/2x half as
  often in play time), every date the game shows (the dock, SimFotos, the message history, accomplishments, hiring dates)
  and Enhanced graphics' seasons (spring blossom and autumn colours, winter snow and its snowy years). Enhanced graphics'
  days of light and weather stay on the game's own clock, so a month holds two or four days of light at the slower
  speeds. Things that measure how long you have played rather than the time of year also stay on the game's clock: the
  course's welcome story and design tip, the advisor's first year on Easy, the opening story pair and the famous golfers'
  challenges (from the second year of play). Switching the speed in the middle of a game carries on from the date
  reached; a championship always keeps the original calendar.
- **Sandbox: pause the calendar.** *(Big change)* The time of year never moves on (it wins over the speed above): golfers keep coming
  and paying, wages and upkeep keep being charged, but no month starts and no year ends, so there is no interest, no
  board, no year-end report and no SGA tournament offer while it is on, and the season stays as it is. Untick it to let
  the calendar go on from where it stood.
- **Sandbox: freeze golfer happiness.** *(Big change)* No golfer's mood ever drops: a bad moment, fatigue at the end of a hole, a sad
  story beat are all undone, while good moments still lift moods. A pair's mood is still set at the first tee from how
  well the two get on (their starting mood). Nobody leaves unhappy.
- **Sandbox: unlock all buildings and landmarks.** *(Big change)* Every building kind, home sites whatever the members' demand and all
  fourteen landmarks of the theme are on the panels from the start, as in Sandbox Mode; the unlock announcements are not
  made. Upgrading a building still needs a Country Club course (10 holes), as in Sandbox Mode. Unticking it takes back only
  what the course has not earned; landmarks the club owns stay.

The three "Sandbox:" switches are what a Sandbox Mode game (unlimited money) is most often wanted with, but each works in
a normal game too.

On the **Looks** page:

- **Path styles and lamps: off / original paths / brick / gravel / dark stone / boardwalk.** Purely for the look; a click
  steps the value. Every path of the course is drawn in the material chosen: red brick in a running bond, pea gravel,
  dark slate flagstones or a wooden boardwalk with its planks across the path, made from the theme's own path art (its
  shading and edges kept) and rounded to the original's colours. Paths cost, join buildings and carry golfers exactly as
  before, and a path not joined to the clubhouse still shows muddy. In a game, **Tab with the Pathway tool in hand** steps
  the course's style on (named in a toast) without opening the box. The landmark strip also gets a page with a **lamp
  post** ($300): press the Landmark button on the Amenities panel (again to reach the page) and click open ground of your
  course (not water, a building, a home site, a tee or a green), one per tile. Shift-click (undo) on its tile takes it away
  with its price back. Lamp posts are drawn by the game in the art's style at every zoom, golfers walk past them (they are
  only decoration), and from dusk their lanterns light up; with Enhanced graphics' time of day each casts a warm pool of
  light on the ground (see docs/ENHANCED.md, *Evening lights*). With the extra off paths look as in the original and lamp
  posts are not drawn (they are kept with the game and come back when it is switched on). The style and the lamp posts
  are saved with the game; a game without them saves as before.

Test hooks: `--extras BITS` sets the extras a new game starts with (1 Tab turns, 2 cut content, 4 hardcore, 8 higher staff
limits, 16 animals, 32 set par, 64 or 128 the calendar at 1/2x or 1/4x, 256 pause the calendar, 512 freeze golfer
happiness, 1024 unlock all, 2048 left-handed golfers, 4096 weather that matters, bits 13 to 15 path styles and lamps (below),
65536 more visitors; not saved to the settings); `--edit "H:N,M,..."` makes golfer slots N, M... left-handed (-1 your
pro); `--edit "V:I,G"` makes golfer slot G (a negative G: the -G-th ordinary golfer out on the course) visitor I of
data/visitors.toml (0..5 the touring pros, 6..13 the celebrities); `--edit "R:N"` asks for par N on the Hole Stats' hole (its
confirmation box; `R:N,1` sets it at once); `--edit "X:BITS"` sets the extras of the game being played; `--edit "T:x,y"`
presses the Tab of the first extra with the pointer on tile x,y; `--edit "S:page[,design]"` opens the Amenities panel with the
landmark tool on strip page 0 (own), 1 (cut) or 2 (animals); `--edit "b:x,y,4,t"` places landmark type t (19..32 the cut ones,
100 + kind an animal pair); `--edit "M:6"` opens the extras box (`M:6,P` on page P: 0 Gameplay, 1 Sandbox, 2
Looks, 3 Info, 4 Helpers; `SG_POPUP_MOUSE="x,y"` leaves the pointer on the box there, so the foot shows that line's
description). Path styles and lamps: the style is bits 13 to 15 of `--extras` and `X:` (8192 times 1 original paths, 2
brick, 3 gravel, 4 dark stone, 5 boardwalk), `--edit "S:3"` opens the lamp page, `--edit "b:x,y,4,200"` places a lamp post
on tile x,y, and `SG_FX_HOUR=0.95` (night) lights the lanterns for stills.

## Cheats (not in the original)

A hidden key on the course, **Ctrl+Shift+C** (it can be moved on the Change keys screen, where it is called *Cheats
box*), opens a **Cheats** box in the style of the game's own menus. Nothing changes until you pick a line; the box stays
open for more until *Done* or Esc:

- **Add §10,000**, **Add §100,000** and **Take away §10,000.** The cash changes at once; the Financial Report's income
  and costs are not touched.
- **Force a VIP visit now.** The next pair to tee off brings a visitor, whatever the ratings the game asks for and
  whichever pair it is (a Sandbox Mode game too): the Corporate CEO, the County Commissioner or the Wealthy Heiress, the
  next one whose turn it is that can come. They play and judge the round as ever, so a pleased commissioner still offers
  land and a pleased heiress still donates a landmark. Greyed while no hole is open, during a tournament, or while one is
  already on the way.
- **Buy all the land.** Every tract of the property still for sale (as the Land screen shows them) becomes yours, for
  nothing (it does not count as a purchase, so it does not raise the price of land later). Greyed when there is none left.
- **Sandbox: pause the calendar / freeze golfer happiness / unlock all buildings and landmarks**, each with its state:
  the same three switches as on the extras box's *Sandbox* page (see above), there in a click.

Using any of the first five marks the game for good ("cheats used", saved with it; the sandbox switches are extras, not
cheats, and do not). The Load Previous Game list then says **Cheats used** beside the course's theme, and a course shared
from such a game (System Functions, *Share course*) carries no challenge: the friend's list shows its course record but
not as one to beat. A game in which no cheat was used saves exactly as before.

In the browser some browsers keep Ctrl+Shift+C for their developer tools' inspector; the page asks them not to, and
where one insists, give the box another key on the Change keys screen.

Test hooks: `--edit "C:N"` uses line N of the box (0 add §10,000, 1 add §100,000, 2 take away §10,000, 3 a VIP, 4 the
land, 5 to 7 the sandbox switches), `--edit "C:0,1"` opens it; `SG_PRESS="Ctrl+Shift+C"` presses its key.

## Searching the Preferences

Preferences has a **Search options...** line, and typing a letter or digit while Preferences is open does the same: a
box that finds an option on any of the Preferences' pages by its words. Type to narrow the list (each word you type must
start a word of the option or of its page's name, in any order and any case; Backspace takes back a letter); it shows up
to ten options at once with the page each is on (an Enhanced graphics page, an extras page, *Graphics* for Enhanced
graphics itself, *Keys* for the keyboard controls), and how many more there are. A click on a found option ticks or
unticks it, or steps a setting with choices, as on its own page; a click on a key opens Change keys with that action
waiting for its new key. **Show only what differs from the original game** keeps the options that are not as a new player
has them. **Reset everything to the original game...** asks first, then puts every option back: every gameplay and
interface extra off, Enhanced graphics off with all its options at their defaults (the bug fixes on, as they are by
default and as the "Original game" choice of Select Difficulty keeps them), and every key back to the original's. The
search box opens again afterwards on the same words. As in the other Preferences boxes nothing changes until its OK
(Enter, or the tick); Esc leaves everything as it was.

Test hooks: `--edit "M:7"` opens the search box (`SG_PREFS_SEARCH="words"` types them first, `SG_PREFS_CHANGED=1` ticks
*Show only what differs*), `--edit "M:8"` its reset question.

## In-game interface (dock, panels, advisor, stories)

The lower left of the course screen now shows the game's own dock art (Interface/3mainLowerLeft.pcx). The three big round buttons open panels along the bottom: **Build Course** (terrain brushes, paths, raise and lower, each with its cost), **Add Buildings** (the amenities for the theme) and **People** (click to hire, right click to fire a club pro, ranger, groundskeeper or soda vendor). Click an item, then click the map. On a Mac, Ctrl+click is a right click (in the app and in the browser), as is a two-finger click on a trackpad with *Secondary click* on. The small buttons zoom, rotate, open the course report, pause, and save the course. The keys are the original's (its F8 screen lists them): g f r s t w p b pick the green/tee, fairway, rough, sand, trees, water, path and bench tools (v the ravine), e the elevation tools, = and - raise and lower the ground under the pointer (Tab steps the elevation brush), h opens the hole being built; z and x zoom between the original's three levels, PageUp and Home turn the view a quarter (0 turns it back), the arrows scroll four tiles, 1 to 9 and Shift+1 to 9 jump to holes 1 to 18; Space drops the tool; Shift+P pause, Shift+T trees, Shift+N names, Shift+R routing map, Shift+W world map, Shift+J begin a tournament, Shift+C save the course for championship play, Shift+S and Shift+L save and load. The original has no game speed control; the port's own ] cycles normal, x2 and x4. With Enhanced graphics on, the port's own c (a key the original leaves unused) opens photo mode (see *Photo mode* below).

System Functions → Preferences → *Keyboard controls...* (the port's own screen) lists every key the game takes, grouped:
moving around the course, time, building, holes and messages, reports and maps, your pro and the golfers, saving and
loading, pictures, and the keys that work everywhere, with the browser's and the Mac's stand-ins. Its pages turn with the
Previous and Next buttons, Left and Right (or PageUp, PageDown, Space), or a click or tap in the box; Esc, Enter, the tick
or a click outside the box close it. (The title menu has no Preferences, as in the original.) `--screen keys` opens it for
stills, `SG_KEYS_PAGE=N` on page N (from 0).

Messages appear at the top of the screen as in the original (the message window): a translucent strip with nobody speaking, or a framed box with the speaker's ball portrait, the newly unlocked building or an icon; a new message replaces the one showing, minor ones wait until it is gone, and Repeat Last Message (Information menu) brings the last one back. On Easy, during the first year, your pro gives advice in a line over his head, in the exe's words. Paused shows at the top centre. Golfer stories play as in the original: a pair that fits a story from your Themes folder gets it at the first tee, and its lines appear at the top as the two walk together (Shift+H hides them); good moods carry it to a Happy Ending, which unlocks a landmark. Special visitors (the Corporate CEO, the County commissioner, the Wealthy heiress) come once your ratings earn them; please them and they invest, approve a land expansion (the TRACTS FOR SALE screen opens) or donate a landmark. Donated and owned landmarks can be placed with the building tool. Story text is read from your disc at run time and is not stored in this project.

## Your pro (Gary Golf)

Open the **People** panel: its first rows are your pro's. **Practice Round** sends him out with a partner; **Match** is lit once a famous golfer has challenged your club, which happens from the second year on when a newcomer with all three skills arrives and you have enough holes. Before his first round you hand out ten skill points (plus three for each accomplishment already earned) in the skill dialog: + and - on each row, then Done. The skills entry opens the dialog again; points won later (his first skill gain, his first match win) are added there.

On each full shot away from the green the game waits for you: move the pointer over the course to aim (the white line shows the shot, bending for a draw or fade; the box sits on the aimed tile or its nearest corner) and click to swing. The panel offers the five shot types (S straight, F fade, D draw, H high backspin, L low punch); fade, draw and high are refused from a hazard. The panel shows his attitude (his momentum), club, distance and lie, with the skills that count for this shot in white and the others in grey. The computer plays his putts and short chips. N, pressed twice, cancels the round; his partner plays on alone.

A match is played for the wager level's stake on each hole and again on the match; losing or tying lowers the stake for the next challenge. Remarkable shots, judged the way the exe judges them, raise one of his skills (up to a cap set by the course's rank); finishing shots in hazards may cost him one. As in the original these are judged only while the view is at its closest zoom and the shot was struck on screen: the game then freezes on a SimFoto of the shot (its track and flight framed in white, red for a bad one) with the message, until you click or press a key (F10 also saves the photo to the snapshots folder); when the photo cannot frame your pro's shot the message goes to the ticker. Other golfers' great shots get a photo too while your pro is not out, the first on each hole. `--screen greatshot` shows one for a still (`SG_GREATSHOT_TEXT` replaces its message). Scripted runs: `--edit "j:0"` starts a practice round and lets him aim at the pin by himself (and take up challenges); `j:0,1` only shows the aim, for stills; `--screen skills` opens the skill dialog.

## SGA tournaments

At the start of the fifth month each year the SGA looks at your course (when your pro is not out). If it passes, the SGA offers a tournament and the People panel shows **Begin Tournament**. Clicking it evaluates the course again: a failing course shows the SGA report (ten criteria scored out of 10, with what the SGA wants for your course's class: length, number of holes, time to play, fun, variety, scenic holes, holes that test length, accuracy and imagination, and facilities joined to the clubhouse); a passing one shows the event, its first prize and **Great, let the games begin!**.

The course empties and a shotgun field starts: two players on each hole, your pro on hole 1 with a famous partner, everyone else a famous pro picked to suit the purse and your cash. A checklist follows: TV towers and booths, extra smooth greens, deeper rough, and each hole's tournament par; untick what you don't want. The leaderboard sits on the left while they play (your pro in green). When the last player is in, the results show each place's prize (the purse for first, two thirds of the place before for each place after, for as many places as you have holes); your pro's prize goes to the club, and places bring trophies. The towers come down, the old golfers come back, and two regular golfers start on each hole. N twice cancels a tournament with no prizes. Scripted runs: `--edit "g:0"` asks the SGA (the evaluation must pass), `g:1` starts one straight away with the default purse, `g:2` the same with no skill points card or trophy room in the way (for stills of the leader board and the Professional Tournament scorecard); `--screen sga` shows the report.

## Play a Championship

In a game, Shift+C (or System Functions, *Save course for Championship*) saves your course for championship play and System Functions, *Save your pro for Championship* saves your pro (into a `Championship` folder next to your saves; pro files use the exe's layout, so the disc's `Themes/Championship/Gary Golf.pro` is listed too). From the title menu, **Play a Championship** lets you pick a difficulty, then a course (Select Championship Course, the Load screen's layout with the course's numbers on the left) and a pro (Pick A Pro: portrait, the ten skills as +N0%, the signature saying), then plays a tournament on it straight away: $100,000 in cash, June, every preparation item taken, the event named by difficulty (SGA Qualifying School to SGA Open Championship), no wages and no accomplishments. When the results are closed you are back at the title menu; nothing is saved. Scripted runs: `--champ COURSE.sgch PRO.pro`, and `--edit "x"` saves the course.

## Life on the course

- **Thoughts:** every mood event shows a line over the golfer who says it (or the partner, for remarks about the golfer), white then grey as it fades, green or red by its tone. Lines start with the words the exe's labels show; the rest is written for this port, since the exe's strings are data.
- **Wildlife:** when you retype the land, an animal whose habitat and theme fit a tile next to it may move in with a young one (elk, cranes, flamingos, sheep, crocodiles, snakes, gila monsters, roadrunners, ducks). They wander, graze or drink, stay in their habitat and run from golfers and low balls; a golfer who startles one is pleased on the easier difficulties. Which kind lives where is our choice (the exe's table is data). A hot-air balloon, a sailboat, a bird of prey and a blimp pass over now and then.
- **Water:** a ball in the water splashes; ripples line the shores, rocks and coral sit in the shallows, and scenic water has dolphins or a fountain.
- **Celebrity homes:** a home site bought by a celebrity becomes one of two celebrity houses, and the celebrity walks about the lot and now and then does a signature move.
- Test hooks: `a:x,y,kind` places an animal, `y:x,y` makes a celebrity home.

## The clubhouse and the records

- Click the clubhouse to choose who tees off next: the golfers waiting are shown newest first; pick two and click outside the cards (no picks cancels).
- People panel, **Golfers on the course**: every golfer playing (hole, name coloured by thirst, hunger, tiredness or anger, and mood). Click one to centre on them and open their card: the five bars (a long bar is bad), the scorecard against par and recent thoughts; X closes it.
- **F10** shows the Professional Accomplishments board, which also opens by itself after each of the 22 accomplishments (from the first Challenge hole to the 100 star rating): a photo card for each, the plaques on the trophy and the next three things to do.
- At each new year the year-end report compares cash, fun, skill and membership with last year and lists the year's highlights from the event log (holes opened, buildings built, matches won, top-rated holes, celebrity homes, tournament places, Happy Endings, land bought).
- **F9** shows the Membership Roster; **F7** shows the SGA evaluation. `--screen pair|board|yearend|roster|golfers` opens them for stills.

## Reports (F keys)

As in the original: **F1** Course Report, **F2** Player Comments (the twenty most frequent comments over all holes, with the hole where each is heard most and how often per tee shot; recent months count more, as every hole's statistics lose an eighth each month), **F3** Histograph (skill, cash, fun and membership month by month, with the event log's highlights), **F4** Financial Report (the ledger by year: green fees, home sites, food and drink, course building, facilities, salaries, maintenance and interest, other, total), **F5** Routing Map (the course in miniature with each hole's tee-to-green line; tabs for course routing (par, yards, minutes), employees and their work areas, course aura (where golfers were happy or unhappy) and home site value), **F7** SGA Evaluation, **F8** Keyboard Shortcuts, **F9** Membership Roster, **F10** Professional Accomplishments. `--screen comments|histograph|finance|routing|shortcuts` opens them for stills. On the routing map, left click selects a hole and right click moves it to another place in the order (the holes between shift, golfers follow; the exe allows this in every tab). **F6** opens the world map to move the club to another property: cash, the calendar and your pro's career go along and the new course starts afresh (Shift+F6 takes a screenshot).

## OpenSGolf extras

The port's own additions to the interface, none of them in the original (crates/simgolf/src/extras.rs and the modules it
names). They only add a screen, a tag, a strip, a button or a save. A new player starts with them off; the Game box on Select
Difficulty turns them on in one click, and System Functions, Preferences,
*OpenSGolf extras...* has a tick for each on its Info and Helpers pages (kept in `settings.json` under `ui_extras`; a tick missing there, as in settings from before it existed, reads as off for the two pauses and the update check), and `--no-extras` turns them all off
for one run. With every tick off the game draws and plays exactly as before (the stills of every report, panel and menu
compare pixel for pixel with the build before the extras).

- **People** (**Shift+G**, or *Information, People*): every golfer on the course, sortable by name, type (visitor,
  member, silver, gold, pro, VIP), hole, mood, handicap and money spent this round (greens fees, food and drink, wagers);
  every employee, sortable by name, job, date hired, weekly wage, golfers served and pay so far; and a *Your pro* tab with
  the original's pro screens a click away (Customise, skills, practice round, match, tournament, under the Player panel's
  own conditions). Click a heading to sort (again to reverse). For a golfer: *Locate* (the camera there), *Follow* (the
  camera keeps on them until they leave, Space, an arrow key or a drag), *Card* (the golfer card) and *Profile*. For the
  staff: *Hire...* (the original's hire dialog with its rules and wages), *Fire* (the Employee panel's, 25 units under
  Salaries), *Move* (the next click on the course is the new post), *Rename* (also the Employee panel's Rename button, which
  the original had and the port lacked), *Locate* and *Follow*. Keys: Left/Right or Tab the tab, Up/Down the row,
  PageUp/PageDown, Enter locate, F follow, C card, P profile; H hire, Delete fire, M move, R rename; 1 to 5 the pro's
  buttons; Esc closes.
- **Golfer profile** (People's *Profile*, or the golfer card's *Profile* button): the portrait, the card's identity lines,
  the roster's record (rounds, best, handicap), the round in progress, the golfer's bio (the person record's own, which
  Customise's Update Bio edits; *Edit bio* or B types one here) and everything the golfer has said on the course this game,
  newest first, good thoughts in green and bad ones in red (kept with the save, the last 60 per golfer).
- **Message history** (**Shift+M**, *Information, Message history*, or a click on the ticker): every ticker message with
  its date and its speaker's portrait or picture, newest first, the last thousand, saved with the game. A click on a message
  takes the camera to the golfer it is about (and opens the card) or to the place it is about.
- **Name tags** (**Shift+H** turns them off and on): the golfer or employee under the pointer gets a small tag with the
  name, a golfer's face of the moment and type or an employee's job, whether the original's names (Shift+N) are on or not.
  Not drawn while a tool is armed, over the dock and its panel, or after the screen has been touched.
- **Tabbed reports**: over the F1 to F10 screens, a strip of ten tabs flips from one report to another without going back
  to the course (on a window taller than 4:3 the strip sits above the page). Click or tap a tab, press Tab or Shift+Tab, or
  another report's F key (or Alt/Ctrl with its digit); the report's own key and Esc close it as before.
- **Path help**: **Shift+V** (or *Information, Path view on / off*) marks every path tile, green when joined to the
  clubhouse and orange when not, and puts a *No path* marker on each building the paths do not reach (the buildings the
  original leaves closed) and on each hole with no joined path within three tiles of its tee, with a legend in the upper
  right. The original's monthly warning that a building is not operational gets a **Show** button on the ticker that takes
  the camera to the building.
- **Autosave**: every five minutes of play (time on the course, not in reports or menus) the game is saved to Saved Games
  as *autosave (Latest)*, so a crash or a closed tab loses at most five minutes. The two autosaves before it are kept too,
  as *autosave (Latest, one before)* and *autosave (Latest, two before)* (files `&Latest.sgs`, `&Latest-2.sgs`,
  `&Latest-3.sgs`; each autosave moves them one along and the oldest goes), listed together, newest first. Test hook:
  `SG_AUTOSAVE_SECS=N` saves every N seconds of play instead. Load them from Load Previous Game like any save.
- **Save pictures**: Load Previous Game draws a map of the selected save's course in the list's top right corner: fairways,
  greens, sand, water, woods, paths and buildings, with the land the club does not own darker. It reads the save itself, so
  older saves get a picture too.
- **Course sharing**: System Functions, *Share course (copy a course code)* copies a code for your course (it starts
  `OPENSGOLF-COURSE-1:`) and saves the course for championship play. Send the code to a friend in a message or a text
  file. They press **Ctrl+V** (Cmd+V on a Mac) anywhere in OpenSGolf, or click *Paste a course code* on Play a
  Championship's course list, and the course joins their championship courses. Dropping a shared `.sgch` course, a saved
  game (`.sgs`) or a text file holding a code on the window brings it in too, and so does Load Previous Game's *Import a
  save file...* button (its *Export this save...* copies a save out; see "Saved games: where they are, backups and
  imports"). The challenge: your course record travels with the course, and the course list shows it to your friend as
  the score to beat.
- **Landing map** (**Shift+D**, or *Information, Landing map on / off*): where the golfers' shots on a hole come to rest,
  as small dots on the course for the hole under the pointer (or the last one pointed at, or the one Hole Stats showed
  last): white the tee shots, yellow the second shots, orange the third, red the fourth and later, with a fainter pip
  where each first came down. Putts are left out. A legend in the upper right counts where the hole's last shots ended:
  fairway, rough, sand, water (a ball taken back for a drop is marked where it went in), green (holed shots count here)
  and anything else (trees, rocks, a ravine, out of bounds). Each hole keeps its last 200 shots from the moment the
  extra is on; building the hole again with its tee or cup elsewhere starts it afresh. Kept with the save while the
  extra is on.
- **Comments by hole** (**Shift+I**, *Information, Comments by hole*, or the *By hole* tab after F10 on the tabbed
  reports): a page with a block for each open hole: the three thoughts golfers had most often while playing it, each on
  its own line with how many times, and how many thoughts in all. Every thought counts (each bubble over a golfer on the
  hole), grouped by kind, in the F2 report's colours: green ones cheered the golfer up ("Made good shot", "Notices
  scenic improvement"), red ones put the golfer out ("Hit into the water", "Too easy shot", "Long wait at tee"), the rest
  are plain. The tabs at the top (or Left/Right) show this month, last month or this year; Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown or
  the wheel scroll through the holes. The words are the Customise screen's dialogue labels where a thought has one, else
  the F2 report's line. With the landing map on too, a click on a hole's block shows its landing map. Kept with the
  save while the extra is on.
- **History graphs** (**Shift+Y**, *Information, History graphs*, or the *Graphs* tab after the others on the tabbed
  reports): from the moment the extra is on, every game month is recorded for the club (rounds finished, holes played,
  revenue and costs as the F4 Financial Report's ledger books them, profit, cash at the month's end, golfer happiness
  (their mood as each hole ends), the fun and skill ratings, members) and for each hole (times played, strokes over par,
  happiness after it, greens fees taken). The page draws one of them as a line over the months on the F3 Histograph's
  page, in its fonts and colours: the tabs at the top choose the club or a hole and the measure (or Up/Down for the
  measure, PageUp/PageDown for the club and the holes, the wheel for the measure), the months along the bottom follow the
  game calendar (with *Slower seasons* a point is still one month of the calendar), and the month under the pointer
  shows its exact value in a box (Left/Right, Home/End, or a click or tap on the plot hold a month up without a pointer).
  The month in progress is drawn paler, as it stands so far. The last 80 months (ten game years) are kept with the save
  while the extra is on; nothing from before it was switched on is shown. Esc, Enter, a right click, the tick or Shift+Y
  close it.

- **Pause in the background** (off, also with the one-click OpenSGolf extras: some players leave the game running in the
  background on purpose): the game pauses when its window goes to the background (another window takes the focus, the
  window is minimised, the browser tab is hidden or the page loses the focus, the Android app is put away) and goes on when
  it comes back. A pause you made yourself stays, and pausing or unpausing in between makes the pause yours. A line under
  the Paused caption says why the game stopped.
- **Pause on big news** (off, also with the one-click OpenSGolf extras): the game pauses right after a VIP (the CEO, the
  county commissioner, the heiress) arrives, a famous golfer challenges your pro, the SGA offers a tournament, the board
  warns about debt at the end of the year (the year-end report follows when the game goes on), or the cash goes below
  zero (not in Sandbox Mode). The news is where the original puts it, on the ticker or the report; *Paused for big news*
  under the Paused caption. Unpause as usual (Shift+P or the dock's pause button).
- **Check for updates when the game starts** (off, also with the one-click OpenSGolf extras: it goes online, which is
  yours to choose): the title menu's *Check for updates* (see *The title menu*), once in the background when the game
  starts. It says nothing unless a newer version is out; then a box offers **Update now**, **Skip this version** (that
  version is not offered at start again, a newer one is; kept in `settings.json` as `update_skip`) or **Not now**. Only
  GitHub is contacted. The browser version has nothing to check.
- **Zoom towards the pointer** (off, also with the one-click OpenSGolf extras: it changes how the original's zoom feels):
  the mouse wheel keeps the ground under the pointer where it is on the screen as it zooms, and a two-finger pinch the
  ground between the fingers, instead of zooming about the middle of the screen. It works at the original's three zoom
  levels and with Enhanced graphics' smooth zoom (frame by frame as the zoom eases). z, x and the dock's zoom buttons
  still zoom about the middle.
- **Drag to place** (off, also with the one-click OpenSGolf extras: it changes what the original's drag does): with
  benches, flower beds, ball washers, willows or scenic bridges armed, hold the left button and drag to lay a row of them
  along the straight line from the tile you pressed to the tile you let go, one on every tile of the line (one per
  footprint for anything larger than a tile), instead of one wherever the pointer passes. While you drag, each item's
  footprint is outlined (white where it can go, red where it cannot) and the number of items and their total cost show
  above the pointer (red when the club cannot afford it; a sandbox shows the count). The row goes down when you let go:
  each item exactly as a click there would place it, with the same rules and price (one that does not fit, or once the
  money runs out, is left out with the click's message), and the whole row is one Ctrl+Z. Esc or a right click before
  letting go cancels it; a click without moving places the one item. Paths (which the original already lays along a
  drag), the terrain brushes, landmarks, home sites and the buildings work as in the original, as does Shift (removing).
  Test hooks: `SG_ROW="x,y"` holds a row from tile x,y to the pointer (`SG_CURSOR_TILE`, with `SG_BUILD=kind` and
  `SG_PANEL_MOUSE`) for stills; `--edit "W:x0,y0,x1,y1,kind"` places a row of object kind `kind` (1 benches, 2 flower beds,
  3 ball washers, 16 willows, 19 bridges) and prints the places, the items that fit, their cost and the cash.
- **Live scorecards** (on with the one-click OpenSGolf extras: it only shows): while a golfer card is open (a click on a
  golfer, the People screen's Card, the profile page's Card) the golfer's round so far is drawn under it on the Player
  panel's own round scorecard, the one the original shows during your pro's round: hole numbers and pars, then the golfer
  and the partner, each hole's score coloured against par as the original colours your pro's (red under par, dark grey
  par, blue and purple over), the hole in progress in grey; the wide last column holds the course's par and each golfer's
  strokes so far, and the score against par (E, +3, -1) stands at the end of each name's bar. Test hook: `--screen card`.
- **Clickable ticker** (on with the one-click OpenSGolf extras): a click on a ticker message said by a golfer takes the
  camera to that golfer and follows him (as People > Follow; any camera move lets go), a click on a message about a place
  (a building with no path, a building's own news) takes it there. A message about nothing on the course opens the
  message history as before (with that extra on); the Show button stays.
- **The year in numbers** (on with the one-click OpenSGolf extras): the End of Year report stays as the original has it;
  its OK then brings a second page in the report's own art, the year's key figures against the year before with a green
  arrow up or a red arrow down: money taken in and profit (the Financial Report's ledger), rounds played, the fun and
  skill ratings, members, the happiest and the unhappiest hole (the golfers' mood as they finish it), and tournaments your
  pro won. Rounds, tournaments and last year's holes are counted by the extra itself from the first year end it sees (a
  dash until then; they are kept with the game only while it is on). Its OK goes on as the report's did (the Top 10
  when due). Test hook: `--screen yearsum` (the season in progress, as `--screen yearend`).
- **Home-site details** (on with the one-click OpenSGolf extras): with the pointer on a home site (no tool in hand), a
  box in the look of the Home Site tool's sums says whose home it is (a celebrity's vacation home names the celebrity),
  what it cost to build and what the lot sold for when placed (the only money a home site brings in), that sale spread
  over the months since (both kept from the moment the extra is on), what a lot there is worth now, what buying it back
  would cost (demolishing it), and which hole sets its value and how much of it that hole makes. Test hook: the edit spec
  `b:X,Y,5` places a home site, `SG_POINTER=x,y` points at it.

These four only show or move the camera; nothing of the game changes. Ticks saved before them read as off.

Test hooks for stills: `--screen people|staff|pro|history|profile|pathview|tags|ticker|card` (with a game;
  Both only watch the game: the golfers play exactly the same with them on or off. Ticks saved before they existed read
  as off (choose them in the extras box).

Test hooks for stills: `--screen people|staff|pro|history|profile|pathview|tags|ticker|card|landing|holecomments|graphs|yearsum` (with a game;
`graphs` with `SG_GRAPHS=S,M[,C]` shows series S (0 the club, 1 to 18 a hole), measure M (its tab, from 0) and holds
month C (from 0) up as a tap would;
`landing` shows the landing map of the first open hole, or of hole N with `SG_LANDING_HOLE=N`; `SG_HOLECOMMENTS=P[,N]` shows comments by hole for period P, 0 this
month, 1 last month, 2 this year, scrolled N holes down;
`SG_PEOPLE_SORT=COL[,1]` sorts the People list by column COL, downward with 1), `--edit "M:6"` opens the extras box.

## Quick save and staff areas

The port's own keys, not in the original; nothing changes until you press them, and both can be moved to other keys
(Change keys).

- **Quick save (Shift+F5)** saves the game at once, without the Save dialog, to Saved Games as *quick save* (the file
  `&Quick.sgs`, replaced each time); the ticker says "Quick saved". As with the championship course, there is no quick
  save during a tournament. **Quick load (Shift+F9)** asks "Load the quick save?" first (anything played since is lost)
  and then loads it; Load Previous Game lists it too. In the browser the quick save stays in the browser's storage with the
  other saves; Shift+F5 and Shift+F9 are kept from the browser (no reload), and Shift + Alt + 5 / 9 work as well.
- **Staff areas (Shift+A)** shows every employee's work ring at once, as the original draws the ring of an employee being
  moved (4 tiles, 6 for a Groundskeeper, 8 for a skilled one, in the job's colour: yellow Groundskeepers, blue Rangers,
  cyan Soda Vendors, grey Club Pros), and tints red every fairway, green and tee tile that no Groundskeeper's ring reaches:
  that is where the next one is wanted. A legend in the upper right counts the staff and the unkept tiles. Press Shift+A
  again to hide it. It only shows; nothing of the game changes. Test hook: `SG_STAFF_VIEW=1` shows it from the start.

## Camera bookmarks and the mouse

The port's own camera helpers (crates/simgolf/src/views.rs); nothing changes until you use them.

- **Camera bookmarks**: **Ctrl+Shift+F1** to **Ctrl+Shift+F4** keep the view (the point in the middle of the screen, the
  zoom and the turn) on bookmark 1 to 4, and **Shift+F1** to **Shift+F4** go back to it (keys the original leaves unused).
  The bookmarks are kept with the game, since they are places on that course: a save holds them once one has been kept,
  and a game without any saves exactly as before. They can be moved to other keys under *Camera bookmark 1* to *4* in
  Change keys; Ctrl with a bookmark's key, whatever it is, keeps the view there. Without Enhanced graphics' smooth camera
  a bookmark comes back at the nearest of the original's three zoom levels. As Alt or Ctrl with a digit stands for an F key,
  Shift+Alt+1 to 4 go back to a bookmark and Ctrl+Shift+1 to 4 keep one (for keyboards whose F keys need Fn).
- **Middle button drag**: dragging with the middle mouse button moves the course whatever tool is held (with the smooth
  camera it coasts on when let go).
- **Zoom towards the pointer**: an OpenSGolf extra (Preferences, *OpenSGolf extras...*, Helpers page), off by default:
  see *OpenSGolf extras* above.

**Ctrl+Z** (Cmd+Z on a Mac) undoes the last click or drag with a building or terrain tool that changed the course:
terrain, paths, holes, buildings and garden items. The whole game goes back to just before it, money included, as if that moment had been saved and loaded.
Up to 30 steps are kept; the list starts empty with each game and is not saved. (The port's own; not in the original.)

### Building tools

The port's own (crates/simgolf/src/build_tools.rs), always there and doing nothing until used: they only show a distance
or save clicks, and paint exactly what the plain brush would.

- **Measuring tape** (**'**, the apostrophe; another key on *Change keys*): hold the key and move the pointer to measure
  from where the pointer was when you pressed it, then let go to leave the reading on the course; or tap the key, move
  the pointer and click to set the far end down. A white line joins the two points with the straight distance in yards
  at its middle, counted as the game counts a hole's length (25 yards a tile, as the hole tool's line from the tee).
  Started on a hole's tee, it also shows the carry from that hole's tee point (*From hole 3's tee: 212 yards*). Esc, a
  right click, a click or the key again put it away. It works at every zoom and turn of the view.
- **Rectangle**: with a terrain brush armed on the Build Course panel, **Shift+drag** paints the rectangle from the tile
  where you pressed to the tile where you let go. While you drag, the rectangle is outlined, the tiles that will change are
  lit and the total cost shows under the pointer (red when the club cannot afford it; a sandbox shows the tile count).
  Esc or a right click before letting go cancels it. A Shift+click without moving paints the one tile, as a click does.
- **Fill**: with a terrain brush armed, **Alt+click** (Option+click on a Mac) paints the whole region of the tile type
  under the pointer, the tiles joined to it edge to edge, up to the edge of the club's land. Holding Alt over the course
  shows the region and its cost before you click.

Both go through the brush's own paint, one tile at a time: the same prices (clearing included) and the same rules (land
the club does not own, obstacles, landmarks and buildings, tees and cups during a tournament, the hole tool's tees and
greens), tiles already of that type are free, and when the money runs out the rest is left as it is. An area is at most
2,500 tiles (the original's whole map); a larger one is refused. Each rectangle or fill is one Ctrl+Z.

Test hooks: `SG_TAPE="x0,y0,x1,y1"` (tiles, fractions allowed) sets a tape down; `SG_AREA="r,x,y"` holds a rectangle from
tile x,y to the pointer (`SG_CURSOR_TILE`) and `SG_AREA=f` holds Alt (with `SG_PAINT=type`, for stills of the previews);
`--edit "B:x0,y0,x1,y1,type"` paints a rectangle and `--edit "L:x,y,type"` fills, printing the tiles, the cost and the cash.

On Windows, macOS and Linux, **F11** or **Alt+Enter** switches between a window and full screen (in the browser, use the
browser's own full screen, F11).

## Keys in the browser and on a Mac

Every key of the original works in the browser too: the page keeps the browser from acting on the keys the game uses
(F1 help, F3 and / find, F5 reload, F6 and F7, F10, Tab, Backspace, Space and the arrows, PageUp and Home scrolling the
page), and a key pressed after the page lost the game's focus goes to the game and gives it the focus back. Cmd
shortcuts stay the browser's; the game needs none. F11 (full screen) and F12 (developer tools) are left to the browser.

The port's own stand-ins, in the browser and on the desktop: **Alt + 1 to 9 and 0** (on a Mac **Option**, ⌥) open what
F1 to F10 open, for keyboards whose function keys need Fn (Macs, most laptops); Ctrl with a digit does the same where
the browser lets it (on a Mac it always does; elsewhere Ctrl + digit may switch tabs). Shift goes with them as with the
F keys (Shift + Alt + 6 is Shift+F6). A Mac keyboard has no PageUp or Home: **fn + ↑** is PageUp and **fn + ←** is Home
(turn the view), or use the dock's turn buttons. In the browser a screenshot (Shift+F6), a SimFoto and a great shot's
photo (F10) are downloaded; saved games and the accomplishment snapshots stay in the browser's storage.

Content packs (mods, docs/MODDING.md): System Functions, Preferences, *Content packs...* lists the installed packs; switch them on or off and order the mods there (Up and Down, or PageUp and PageDown on the picked row). The choices are saved in `settings.json` at once and take effect the next time the game starts. `--screen content` opens the screen for stills. *Save profile...* keeps the current choices under a name and *Profiles...* lists the saved ones to load (the choices then take effect at the next start) or delete. A game saved with other packs than the ones in use asks before it loads from *Load Previous Game*: switch to the save's packs (the desktop game starts again on them and loads the save; on Android and in a browser restart or reload, then load it), load it anyway, or not load it (docs/MODDING.md 2).

Scenarios (docs/MODDING.md 5): with a scenario pack installed, *Start New Game* first offers a free game (the original's
way on: Select Difficulty, then a property) or one of the scenarios, each with its goals; a scenario that names no
difficulty goes by way of Select Difficulty. Messages say when a goal is reached or missed and when the scenario is won or
lost; *Information, Scenario Goals* (the menu's last line, shown when the game has goals) lists them. The Save dialog's
*Export as scenario pack* button (or Tab) writes the game as a scenario pack into the save folder's `packs`, under the
name typed. Scripts of the enabled packs run by themselves (docs/MODDING.md 6); when one fails a toast says so and the
Content screen shows the error. *Find more...* on the Content screen lists the packs of the content index set in
`settings.json` (`content_index_url`, docs/CONTENT_INDEX.md) and downloads them. Test hooks: `--scenario ID` starts a
scenario pack (Moderate when it names no difficulty), `--screen scenarios` (from the title) and `--screen goals` or
`--screen content-index` (with a game) open those screens, `SG_INDEX_DOWNLOAD=N` downloads offer N of the index at once,
`SG_EXPORT_SCENARIO=1` exports the game as a scenario pack.

## Changing the keys

The port's own (crates/simgolf/src/controls.rs and controls_ui.rs), in the browser and on the desktop alike. With nothing
changed every key does what it did before.

* **Change keys.** System Functions → Preferences → *Keyboard controls...* → *Change keys...* lists every action of the
  course screen with its key: the original's (tools, screens, the F keys, the shot shapes while your pro aims) and the
  port's own (game speed, photo mode, hiding the interface, the measuring tape, the course editor's box, the hidden Cheats
  box). Click an action, then press its new key, with or without Shift (and Ctrl); Esc (or a click) while it waits keeps
  the old key. Two actions on one key are printed in red and a line says which: only one of them answers (the shot shapes only clash with each other, since they count only while your pro
  aims). *Reset to defaults* puts every key back. The digits (holes 1 to 18) and Esc cannot be given to an action. The
  keys are saved at once under `"controls"` in `settings.json` (only the ones that differ, e.g.
  `"controls": {"wasd": false, "keys": {"water": "Shift+Q", "zoom_in": "G"}}`; an action set to `""` has no key) and the
  *Keyboard controls* screen prints the keys in use.
* **WASD camera** (off by default). W, S and D are the original's water, sand and (while your pro aims) draw keys, so
  WASD scrolling is a choice on the Change keys screen: with it on, **w a s d** scroll as the arrow keys do (the arrows
  still work), the water tool moves to **q** and the sand tool to **k**; while your pro aims, s and d stay the straight
  shot and the draw.
* **Original and Modern controls** (two buttons under the list on Change keys; nothing changes until one is clicked, and
  the one in use is lit yellow). *Original controls* puts every key back to the original's and turns the WASD camera,
  *Zoom towards the pointer*, *Drag to place* and Enhanced graphics' *Smooth camera* tick off. *Modern controls* puts
  every key back to its default with the WASD camera on, and turns *Zoom towards the pointer* and *Drag to place* (both
  OpenSGolf extras, Helpers page) and the *Smooth camera* tick (which counts only while Enhanced graphics is on: the
  preset never switches Enhanced graphics itself) on. They only set those existing options, which stay changeable one by
  one; click the other preset to undo one (keys you moved yourself are not kept by either).
* **Middle-button drag** (always on) drags the course whatever tool is held, as a left drag does with no tool.
* **u** hides the whole interface (dock, panels, messages, the money and ratings) during normal play, for a clear view of
  the course; a small note in the bottom left corner says which key brings it back. Clicks then go to the course. Photo
  mode (Enhanced graphics) has its own view and is not affected.
* **Frame rate.** Enhanced graphics settings → *Display* has *Frame rate cap* (30, 60, 120, 144, 240 a second or
  uncapped, the default) and *V-sync* (on by default); both count with Enhanced graphics off too. Only how often the
  screen is drawn changes: the game itself always runs on its 87 ms ticks. On the desktop the cap waits out the rest of
  each frame; v-sync takes effect at the next start (macOS and Android always pace to the display). In a browser the page
  skips animation frames to keep under the cap, and v-sync cannot be turned off: browsers always draw on the display's
  refresh. If the browser game ever stays stuck on its first picture, *Reset graphics settings* on the start page (or
  `?safe` at the end of the page's address) puts the Enhanced graphics settings, frame rate cap included, back to their
  defaults without touching saved games.

Test hooks: `SG_PRESS="u;Shift+Q;..."` presses keys (the names `settings.json` uses) after a scripted still's first frame,
after `SG_CLICK`; letters and Space also type their character.

## Controllers and the Steam Deck

An Xbox, PlayStation, Switch Pro or Steam Deck controller plays the whole game (the port's own; on Windows, macOS, Linux,
in the browser and in the Android app):

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| Left stick | moves the pointer (the game draws it while the controller is in use; moving the mouse gives it back) |
| Right stick | scrolls the course |
| A | click; hold to drag or paint |
| B | on the course a right click (undo, remove); on other screens Esc (close, back) |
| X | Tab (turn a building, or the next design) |
| Y | game speed (]) |
| LB / RB | turn the view |
| LT / RT | zoom out / in |
| D-pad | the arrow keys (scroll, lists) |
| Start | Esc (System Functions: save, load, quit) |
| Back / Select | pause |
| Left stick click | open a hole (h) |
| Right stick click | the last message again (?) |

**Steam Deck:** download the Linux AppImage (`opensgolf-linux-x86_64.AppImage`) in Desktop Mode, make it executable
(Properties, Permissions, "Is executable"), then in Steam use *Games, Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library* and pick it.
In Game Mode the game starts full screen and the Deck's controls work as above (pick the *Gamepad* controller layout if
Steam offers another). The trackpads move the mouse as usual. To name a course or a save, press Steam + X for Steam's
keyboard. `--fullscreen` starts full screen on any computer (F11 or Alt+Enter switches while playing).

## Touch (phones and tablets)

The same touch controls work in the browser and in the Android app (crates/simgolf/src/touch.rs).

In a browser the game covers what can be seen of the page (the visual viewport), and follows Safari's address, tab and
bottom bars as they show and hide and the device as it turns: on an iPad or iPhone the bottom of the game (the dock, a
panel's lower row) used to sit under the bars (web/opensgolf.js `sgFitCanvas`).

Tap for a click; drag one finger to scroll the course (or to paint with the selected tool); hold a finger still for half a
second for a right click (undo, remove, close a screen). With the raise / lower tool (the Elevation panel, or =), a tap raises
the ground and holding a finger still for half a second lowers it instead (the keyboard's Shift+click); keep the finger down
and drag to go on lowering along the way. With two fingers: drag to scroll, pinch to step through the three
zoom levels, twist to turn the view a quarter. Once the screen has been touched, four buttons on the right stand in for keys
that have no button in the game: Open hole (h), Turn (Tab), Speed (]) and Message (?). Naming a course or a save raises the
phone's keyboard (in the browser through a hidden text box on the page, on Android the system keyboard). In the browser
the game also draws its own keyboard across the bottom of the screen while a name is typed, with **OK** (Enter) and
**Cancel** (Esc), because Safari on an iPad raises its keyboard only for some taps and a name box closes only with those
keys (issue #50).

### Android

Installing the APK (sideloading) is described in the README, [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The app runs in landscape and
full screen, starts on the free base set, and keeps its saves, settings, content packs and championship files in its private
storage (`Context.getFilesDir()`, removed when the app is uninstalled). To play with your own copy of SimGolf, tap **Use my
SimGolf files...** and pick a .zip of the SimGolf folder or the folder itself in Android's file picker
(ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT / ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE, no storage permission needed): the app copies it into
`Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/game/`, showing how far it is, and starts again on it. Copying the game's
`Program_Files_(ENGLISH)` folder there by hand works too, but Android 11 and newer hide `Android/data` from file managers and
USB transfers (`adb push` still reaches it).
The back button works as Esc: it closes the screen that is open, on the course opens System Functions (save, load, quit),
on the title screens goes back to the title menu, and on the title menu leaves the game. Sound goes through the phone's
audio output (AAudio or OpenSL ES, through cpal's oboe backend); an APK whose sound could not be built (tools/android_build.sh
falls back to a silent build) plays without it. Everything the game prints goes to the system log (tag `OpenSGolf`), and a
crash is also written to `Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/crash.txt` (INSTALL.md says how to get either). A GPU that
will not compile an Enhanced graphics shader turns those effects off for the run instead of closing the game, and a game
folder without the course textures (a copy cut short) is set aside for the free base set. The content packs and translations that the desktop packages put next to
the program are not inside the APK yet, and the app's packs folder is in its private storage (TODO: bundle the packs as
assets and read player packs from the external files folder).

## Enhanced graphics

System Functions → Preferences → the *Enhanced graphics* tick, or *Enhanced graphics settings...* for the details (the port's own, not in the original; docs/ENHANCED.md) turns on a
way of drawing the game for large and wide screens: sharp text, smooth interface art (with smooth outlines for the colour-keyed buttons, icons and sprites instead of stair steps), the HUD at the window's corners on a
wide window, sharper and anti-aliased course, a smooth camera and smooth motion. Each part has its own tick; Classic stays
the default. With the smooth camera the mouse wheel and a pinch zoom continuously between the three levels (z, x and the
zoom buttons still step to the next level), turns are animated, arrow-key scrolls glide and a dragged course coasts to a
stop. The screen has three pages, chosen with the tabs along its top (a click or a tap; Left, Right or Tab on the
keyboard): *Display* (the master switch and the options above), *Effects* (the shader effects, cast shadows, the balls'
trail and impacts, and the effects' quality, which a click steps through low, medium and high) and *Atmosphere* (sky, time
of day, cloud shadows, haze, rain, mist and the post-processing). The master switch heads every page. `--enhanced` and
`--classic-render` switch it for one run. Test hooks: `--edit M:5` opens the screen (`M:5,P` on page P, 0 to 2);
`SG_POINTER=x,y` moves the pointer and `SG_CLICK=x,y[;x,y...]` clicks, in window pixels, after the first frame of a
scripted still (for checking where clicks land on a wide window).

### Photo mode

With Enhanced graphics on, **C** (or the camera button under the rating pills, top right; a tap on a phone) opens photo
mode (docs/ENHANCED.md, "Photo mode"): the interface goes, the game pauses (Space or P runs it on), and the camera is free:
drag or the arrows to move, the wheel, a pinch, Z / X or + / - to zoom well past the usual levels, PageUp / Home to turn. A
click or tap puts the focus there; F turns the focus blur on and off, [ and ] set its strength, L steps through the looks
(Natural, Warm, Vivid, B&W, Vintage), V the vignette, R the size (window, twice the window, 4K), Enter takes the photo, H
hides the hint and buttons, Esc or C leaves and puts everything back. Buttons along the bottom do the same by mouse or
touch. Photos are PNGs in `Photos` in the save folder; the browser downloads them; on Android they go to
`Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/Photos`. The Display page's *Photo mode* tick turns the key and the button off. Test
hook: `--edit "P:LOOK,BLUR,VIGNETTE,ZOOM,HINT,SHOOT"` opens photo mode for stills (LOOK 0 to 4, BLUR 0 to 5, VIGNETTE 0 or
1, ZOOM in percent of the closest level or 0, HINT 1 to show the hint and buttons, SHOOT 1 to 3 to take a photo at the
window's size, twice it or 4K); `SG_CLICK=x,y` sets the focus first.

### Enhanced graphics: the effects

The effects are ticks on the same screen; `--fx` turns on only the optional shader effects for one run (docs/ENHANCED.md, "Effects"): smoother magnified sprites and interface art,
animated water, terrain light with occlusion and shadows, a sky beyond the map, colour grading, bloom and vignette.
`--fx-set LIST` picks options (`scaler=off|sharp|edge`, `water`, `lighting`, `occlusion`, `shadows`, `sprite-shadows`,
`sky`, `tilt-shift`, `grading`, `bloom`, `vignette`, `cast-shadows`, `time-of-day`, `clouds`, `haze`, `rain`, `mist`,
`ball-trail`, `ball-impacts`, `reflections`, `wind`, `evening-lights`, `seasons`, `after-rain`, `lightning`, `heat`, `life`, `crowds`, `winter`, `sharpen`, `grass`,
`water-colour`, `waves`, `shoreline`, `caustics`, `rain-rings`, `water-life`, `ice`, `spray` = on/off,
`quality=low|medium|high`, `day-length=short|normal|long`), `--fx-list` prints them, and `OPENSGOLF_FX` does the
same from the environment. Without them the game looks exactly as before. Test hooks: `SG_FX_BENCH=N` with `--png` prints
the frame time over N frames, `SG_FX_LOG=1` the light map's build time, each ball's landing (where, on what, at which
tick) and the bodies of water with where the fountains and waterfalls are, `SG_FX_DUMP=FILE` writes the light map, `SG_FX_SOFT=sharp,edge` overrides the scaler's softness (texels),
`SG_FX_HOUR=P` holds the time of day at phase P (0 dawn, 0.15 morning, 0.5 midday, 0.85 golden hour, 0.89 sunset, 0.95
dusk) and `SG_FX_RAIN=1` (or `0`) makes every day wet (dry) while rain is on. For stills of the newer effects:
`SG_FX_MONTH=M` holds the calendar month (3 March .. 10.99 late October, fractions allowed: 4.5 is mid April),
`SG_FX_WIND=S` or `S,DEG` fixes the wind's strength (0 calm .. 1 a strong breeze) and its direction (degrees from the
screen's right towards its top), `SG_FX_WET=W` makes the ground that wet with its puddles that far spread,
`SG_FX_RAINBOW=K` shows a rainbow, `SG_FX_LIGHTNING=K` a lightning flash of that brightness, `SG_FX_HEAT=K` makes
every day a heat wave that hot (0 to 1), and `SG_FX_FACETED=1` lights the ground with the tiles' flat faces as before the
smooth normals (for comparisons). `SG_FX_RAIN` and `SG_FX_HEAT` also set the game's weather while *Weather that matters*
is on (an always-wet course is a storm day on about four days in ten).

### Time of day and weather

With *Time of day* on, a day of light lasts three game months (about four and a half minutes at normal speed; *Day
length* on the Atmosphere page picks short, one month as in the first versions, normal, or long, six months): the day
opens in the morning, has a long midday in the
original's light, a golden afternoon, a sunset and a short blue dusk, then the next month dawns. The sun swings round the
front of the view, so shadows lengthen sideways rather than down the screen, and the course never gets darker than an
easy-to-read dusk; the interface is not touched. *Rain* follows the property's climate
(rarely in the desert, often in Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and each year is wetter or drier than usual, the same days
whenever the save is loaded; the light dims and the shadows fade while it rains. *Mist* lies in
hollows and over water, thick at dawn and gone by late morning with the time of day (a light mist all day without it).
*Cloud shadows* drift over the course, *haze* pales the far (upper) part of the view, more when zoomed out. None of these
changes the game: golfers play the same in rain or at dusk. Rain spells, the cloud cover and the wind last a whole day of
light and blend into the next day's over the first and last eighth of it, so the weather comes and goes gently (the short
day length keeps the first versions' sudden changes).

The **Weather** page and the newer Atmosphere options (docs/ENHANCED.md has the details):

- *Reflections and sun glitter on the water* (on): trees, buildings and golfers standing near water are mirrored in it,
  rippling with the waves; the sun's glitter grows warm and strong at golden hour; the water laps at the shore.
- *Wind* (on): each day has its wind; trees, palms, bushes and tall grasses lean and sway in gusts, flags fly downwind, the
  rain slants and the clouds drift with it.
- *Lit windows, lamps and fireflies at dusk* (on, with the time of day): from sunset the buildings' windows glow, lamps
  light up beside the buildings and along the paths, and fireflies drift over the rough on parkland and tropical courses.
- *Seasons* (on): blossom on the trees and fresh greens in March and April, autumn colours in September and October, frost
  and dew on spring and autumn mornings (with the time of day). Palms, cacti and conifers barely change.
- *Wet ground, puddles and rainbows* (on, with rain): during a rainy day and drying through the next the ground is darker
  and glossy, puddles fill on level fairway and rough and shrink as they dry, and about every other time the sun comes out
  after rain a rainbow stands in the sky.
- *Lightning in heavy rain* (off): flashes and distant flicker in the heaviest rain on parkland and links courses (with
  the *Weather that matters* extra on, on its thunderstorm days only).
- *Heat waves in the desert* (off): on a desert course's hot summer days a warm, bleached midday light, a heat haze over
  the distance and, on the hottest days, parched grass that greens again after (the same days *Weather that matters*
  plays). It costs nothing measurable.

## Language

The game is in English unless a translation is installed (docs/TRANSLATING.md): then System Functions > Preferences has a
`Language:` line that switches to the next language and remembers it (`"language"` in `settings.json`). Test hooks:
`--lang CODE` uses a language for one run, `--lang-file FILE` lays a translation file over the English, and the
environment variable `SG_TEXTLOG=FILE` writes every text drawn or posted to the message window to FILE, each once.
