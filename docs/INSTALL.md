# Installing OpenSGolf: the details

Every [release](https://github.com/crspytopgn/opensgolf/releases) has a package for each platform: unpack it and
double-click. It starts on the free base set. Have SimGolf? Choose **Use my SimGolf files...** on the title screen (or in
Preferences) and pick either **a .zip** of your SimGolf folder (the same .zip the browser version takes), **a CD image**
of the SimGolf disc (an `.iso`, a Mac's `.cdr`, or a .zip holding one), or **a folder**: the one SimGolf is installed in (or
the CD's `Program_Files_(ENGLISH)` copied to your computer, or any folder above it), or **the SimGolf CD itself** (or a
copy of all its files), which needs no installing: the game unpacks the disc's own installer files (`DATA1.HDR`,
`DATA*.CAB`) as it does from an .iso. The game remembers it. A .zip is unpacked into the game's own folder (`game` in the save folder), leaving out the videos, the
Windows programs and a Mac's `__MACOSX` files; afterwards the .zip is no longer needed. It also finds a usual install by itself (`Program Files\Maxis\SimGolf`, `~/SimGolf`, a Wine install, or a
`SimGolf` folder next to the program; the full list is in [PLAYING.md](PLAYING.md#your-own-simgolf-files)). *Use the free
graphics* goes back. No Terminal and no options are needed (`--game DIR` remains for scripts).

If your copy's `Sounds` and `SimsFX` folders are empty (some downloaded copies leave the sounds out), the game still
plays, with the free OpenSGolf sounds, and says so once when it starts (the browser page too, after loading the files); a
full installed copy or the CD has the original's. A .zip is read whether it was made with normal (Deflate) compression or
by Windows' own zipper, which uses Deflate64 for big files such as the sounds, or with 7-Zip's, Keka's or The
Unarchiver's stronger settings (BZip2, LZMA, PPMd): iPad's Files app cannot unpack those and shows the folders empty;
OpenSGolf can, in the browser, the desktop app and Android alike. Files in other compressions (Zstandard, XZ) and
encrypted ones are left out and the game says how many; unpack such a zip (or a .7z or .rar) on a computer and pick the
folder, or zip it again with normal compression. The browser page shows its version at the bottom (OpenSGolf 0.5.1):
an older one there is a copy the browser kept; reload the page.

* **Windows**: unzip `opensgolf-windows.zip` anywhere and double-click `opensgolf.exe` (no console window opens). Windows
  SmartScreen may warn that the program is unknown (it is not signed): *More info*, *Run anyway*. Saves go to
  `%APPDATA%\OpenSGolf` (the games in its `Saved Games`: copy them to back up or move them; docs/PLAYING.md, "Saved games:
  where they are, backups and imports").
* **macOS** (Apple silicon and Intel): unzip `opensgolf-macos.zip` and move `OpenSGolf.app` to Applications. It is not
  notarised, so the first time right-click it and choose *Open*; on macOS 15 and newer that no longer offers *Open*:
  double-click it once, then System Settings → Privacy & Security → *Open Anyway* (near the bottom), and confirm. If macOS
  says the app "is damaged and can't be opened", that is the download's quarantine flag, not damage: in Terminal run
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OpenSGolf.app` once. Saves go to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenSGolf`.
  **Your SimGolf files on a Mac**: SimGolf is a Windows game, but nothing has to be installed. The simplest ways:

  - **The CD itself**: put the SimGolf CD in (or plug in a USB CD drive), choose **Use my SimGolf files...**, then **A
    folder, or the SimGolf CD**, and pick the CD under *Locations* in the picker's sidebar (it has the name Finder shows
    for it, such as SIMGOLF; it lives in `/Volumes`). A folder with a copy of everything on the CD works the same way.
  - **A CD image**: choose **A .zip, .iso or .cdr file** and pick an `.iso` of the CD, or a `.cdr` made with Disk Utility:
    with the CD in, open Disk Utility, choose *File* → *New Image* → *Image from "(the CD)"*, set *Format* to **DVD/CD
    master** and save; that makes a `.cdr` file (the same as an .iso; renaming it is not needed). Disk Utility's other
    formats (compressed, read-only and the like) make a `.dmg`, which OpenSGolf cannot read: it says so and how to make the
    .cdr instead.
  - **An installed copy**: **A .zip, .iso or .cdr file** and a .zip of a SimGolf folder from a Windows PC (a folder picker
    on a Mac greys out .zip files, which is why the game asks which one first), or **A folder, or the SimGolf CD** and the
    unpacked SimGolf folder.

  Either way the files are copied into `~/Library/Application Support/OpenSGolf/game` (the CD, image or .zip is not needed
  afterwards), because macOS's privacy rules may stop the game from reading Desktop, Documents or Downloads on a later start. When macOS asks whether
  OpenSGolf may access files in one of those folders, choose *Allow*; if you chose *Don't Allow* before, turn OpenSGolf on
  under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files and Folders (the game says so when it cannot read a folder). A right
  click is Ctrl+click or a two-finger click. No sound? The game plays on the Mac's current output device and follows a
  change (headphones, AirPods, another output in Control Centre) within two seconds; if it stays silent, start it from
  Terminal with `/Applications/OpenSGolf.app/Contents/MacOS/opensgolf` and look for the lines starting with `sound:`.
* **Linux** (x86_64, and 64-bit ARM such as a Raspberry Pi 4/5: the `-arm64` files): the AppImage (allow running it as a program in its Properties, or `chmod +x`, then double-click it), or
  unpack the `.tar.gz` and run `opensgolf` in its folder (`opensgolf.desktop` and `opensgolf.png` in it are for a menu entry).
  The folder picker asks the desktop through the XDG portal (GNOME, KDE and most desktops have it). Sound goes through ALSA
  (PulseAudio and PipeWire provide it). Saves go to `~/.local/share/opensgolf`.
* **Android** (8.0 or newer; arm64, 32-bit arm and x86_64): download `opensgolf-android.apk` on the phone or
  tablet and open it. Android asks once to allow installing apps from the browser or file manager you used (*Install
  unknown apps*); allow it and install. The app is not in an app store and is signed with a development (debug) key, so a
  newer version may refuse to install over an older one: then uninstall the old one first (that removes its saves; copy them
  out of the app first if you want them, see below). The game plays in landscape, full screen, by touch
  ([docs/PLAYING.md, Touch](PLAYING.md#touch-phones-and-tablets)). **Your own copy of SimGolf on Android**: put a .zip of
  your SimGolf folder (or the folder itself) anywhere on the phone (Downloads, a USB stick, Google Drive...), tap **Use my
  SimGolf files...** on the title screen, choose **A .zip file** or **A folder**, and pick it in Android's file picker
  (for a folder, Android asks to *Allow* OpenSGolf to see it; it cannot pick the top of the storage or the Download folder
  itself, so put the SimGolf folder in a folder of its own). The game copies the files into its own storage, showing how far
  it is, and starts again with them; afterwards the .zip or folder you picked is no longer needed. A .zip is the quickest way
  (Android's folder picker copies file by file). The files end up in `Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/game/`; copying
  them there by hand also still works, but Android 11 and newer hide that folder from file managers and USB (only `adb push`
  reaches it). Saves, settings and packs are in the app's private storage (`/data/data/org.opensgolf.game/files`).
  **If the app closes right away**: version 0.1.0's APK closed the moment it was opened on every phone (its library could not
  be loaded: the C++ runtime of the sound output was missing from it); install a newer one. Should the app still close or
  freeze, the next start shows a box saying so, whose **Copy the report** button copies what went wrong (paste it into an
  issue or a message). It also writes what went wrong to `Android/data/org.opensgolf.game/files/crash.txt` on the device's storage (copy it to
  a computer over USB, or open it with a file manager that shows `Android/data`) and to the system log under the tag
  `OpenSGolf`: with USB debugging on (Settings → About phone → tap *Build number* seven times, then Developer options → *USB
  debugging*) and the phone on a computer with the Android platform tools, `adb logcat -s OpenSGolf` shows the game's
  messages while it starts (`adb logcat -d > log.txt` saves the whole log, which also has Android's own reason when the app
  cannot even start). Please attach `crash.txt` or that log to a report on the issue tracker, with the phone's model and
  Android version.
  Building the APK yourself: `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/root/src -w /root/src notfl3/cargo-apk tools/android_build.sh`
  (see the script; CI builds a debug APK on every push, artifact `opensgolf-android-debug`).
* **If the game crashes** on Windows, macOS or Linux, it writes what went wrong to `crash.txt` in its save folder:
  `%APPDATA%\OpenSGolf` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/OpenSGolf` on a Mac (Finder: Go → Go to Folder…), and
  `~/.local/share/opensgolf` on Linux. Please attach it to a report on the issue tracker, with what you clicked just before.
* **Updating**: on the title menu, **Check for updates** says whether a newer version is out, and **Update now**
  downloads it, checks its signature and installs it over this copy, then starts it (details and what is sent in
  [PLAYING.md, The title menu](PLAYING.md#the-title-menu)). It works for the packages as they come: the Windows and
  Linux `.tar.gz` folder (the game must be allowed to write to its folder), the AppImage, `OpenSGolf.app` (where you
  may change it: in `/Applications` as an administrator, or anywhere in your home folder) and the Android app (Android
  asks you to confirm; it installs over the old app only when both are signed with the same key). Your saves and
  settings are elsewhere and stay as they are. Where it cannot update itself (a build from the sources, a folder it may
  not write to, a release without a valid signature) it says why and opens the download page instead: download the new
  package and install it as the first time. The *Check for updates when the game starts* tick (Preferences,
  off by default) asks once at each start.
* **No sound?** The game writes what it found and what it plays on to `sound.txt` in the same save folder (20 seconds after
  it starts, then every two minutes; in the browser the same lines go to the console, F12). Please attach it to a report.
* **Browser**: nothing to install, see [Play in your browser](https://crspytopgn.github.io/opensgolf/); `opensgolf-web.zip` is the
  same page to host yourself. It takes your SimGolf folder, a .zip of it, or the CD: an `.iso` or a Mac's `.cdr` (also
  inside a .zip), a .zip of the CD's files, or the CD picked as a folder, unpacked in the page (a `.dmg` cannot be read:
  make a `.cdr` as above). On an iPad or iPhone, a CD image in the Files app works too.
* **From source**: see [Build and run](../README.md#build-and-run).

The application icon (a flag on a green and a ball) is drawn by the engine itself (`sgtool icon DIR`; `tools/make_icons.sh`
refreshes the Android launcher icons).
